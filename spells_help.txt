Topic: animate_object  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: animate object
Class: cleric L6, bard L6
Sphere: alteration
Saving throw: will
Syntax: cast <classname> animate object on <object> || <room>

This spell allows you to animate objects and command then.  <command
objects to command> will command the object to act as instructed.  Forcing
an object to do something will affect your alignment when appropriate.  If
you cast the spell on 'room', you will animate the objects located on the
floor of the room (non living).  If you cast it on a non-living target,
that object will become animated.  If you cast it on a living being, items
from that being's inventory will be animated.

Enchanted objects cannot be animated.  Objects will take damage in combat
and may be destroyed.  The objects will remain animated until the spell
ends or you <dismiss objects>.

There is a level effect that limits how large or how many objects you can
animate.

Topic: insect_plague  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: insect plague
Class: cleric L5, druid L5
Sphere: conjuration_summoning
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> insect plague

This spell of a conjuration/summoning nature calls forth all the stinging,
flying, crawling, creeping and biting insects within a one mile radius to
swarm together within the immediate surroundings of the caster. The swarm
will then annoy and harm everything in the area except the one who summoned
it. If cast within the presence of other beings, the caster may find that
the swarm annoys its victims so much that they attack the caster out of
anger and fear. At anytime the caster may send the swarm away by: <disperse
swarm>.

*spells

Spell: incendiary cloud
Class: mage/sorc L8
Sphere: invocation_evocation
Saving throw: varied
Syntax: cast <classname> incendiary cloud

Upon casting this spell, the mage conjures a heaving mass of smoke and
flames that blankets the area, scorching those who dare attack the caster. 
Like most fires, this one requires a brief time to build to a raging
inferno before it fizzles out again, leaving devastation in its wake.  If
the caster leaves the area, the cloud will dissipate. A versatile arcanist
can manipulate the base element of this spell.

Spell: invisibility
Class: mage/sorc L2, bard L2
Sphere: illusion
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> invisibility (on <target>)

This spell generally will let the caster turn himself or another creature
or player invisible until one of the three conditions are met.  The
invisible target has chosen to <appear> to all by typing that, the target
started a fight or was attacked, and the final way the spell would wear off
is from time.  The spell will last generally a long time if left to wear
off however.  Maintaining this spell can become wearying to the caster over
time.

Spell: lightning orb
Class: mage/sorc L3
Sphere: invocation_evocation

Syntax: cast <classname> lightning orb on <target>

This spell allows a mage to tap into the Para-Elemental Plane of Lightning
and borrow some of its energy to create an orb of pure lightning.  Once the
orb is launched into the air, the first thing it strikes will cause it to
burst open, releasing the shocking attack on the mage's foes.  Though care
should be taken as it is possible to accidently catch the mages allies in
the blast.

to touch the target, the lighting dispurses into a flashy, but harmless
effect.

Topic: magic_mirror  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: magic mirror
Class: mage/sorc L7
Sphere: divination
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> magic mirror on <object> (a scrying mirror)

By means of this spell, the wizard changes a normal mirror into a scrying
device similar to a crystal ball. The details of the use of such a scrying
device can be accessed by typing <help mirror> after a successful cast on a
mirror.  You will be able to scry a player character or a location with the
scrying device made by this spell.

The mirror used must be of finely wrought and highly polished silver of a
minimum cost of 1,000 gp.  These mirrors are generally found only in
wizard's laboratories as they are both large and fragile, making them
impossible to carry around.

You will not be able to scry a character that you have not recognized
previously with the 'recognize' command.  Your chance of success in using
the mirror on a character is less if you recognize someone as something
other than their true name, but its better than nothing.  You may not scry
locations at all unless they are in memory via the remember command.

There is also a chance that the target of the spell may notice that they
are being scryed.  This depends on their class, and is adjusted
significantly by intelligence.  This operates independantly of any scry
detection magic or devices.  This spell can only be cast while at peace.

Topic: mindnet  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: mindnet
Class: cleric L9, psion L8
Sphere: divination
Discipline: telepath
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> mindnet to <target>

This power is otherwise known as mass telepathy. It will allow the psion to
open a telepathy spell with more than one target at the same time.  Each
target will be able to 'hear' the thoughts of the other targets in the
mindnet.  The mindnet takes the game mechanic form of a line in the name
that the caster has themselves recognized as.

The actual name of the line is not considered to be IC information, but
rather a mechanical method by which to facilitate the spell. The caster
must cast the spell multiple times to add more targets to the spell, and
each time they cast the spell on a new target, that target is added to the
existing mind link.  It is possible for a person to be in two or more
mindnets at the same time, but it is not possible for one caster to have
two seperate mindnet spells under their control at the same time. The
caster may remove a person from the mindnet at any time by using <mindnet
remove target>.

When a psion manifests microcosm, he affects the target's mind to make him
feel as though he is happily in a world of his own, effectively rendering
the target utterly helpless.  The success of the power depends upon the

Spell: mark of justice
Class: cleric L5, paladin L4
Sphere: divination
Domain: vigilance
Saving throw: fort
Syntax: cast <classname> mark of justice on <target>

This spell allows the caster to attempt to plant a mark of justice on the
target.  This mark is mostly inconspicuous, being more an outpouring of the
caster's energy than a physical mark.  It will allow the caster to <observe
mark> once while the spell is in effect, giving the caster a means to scry
the target.  It is often used in investigations of suspicious persons, and
as such, it has been developed to be somewhat quietly cast.

Spell: mind fog
Class: mage L6

Syntax: cast <classname> mind fog on <target>

Known only to some of the most powerful enchanters of the realm, this spell
does no visible damage to the victim.  Instead, it serves to cloud the mind
of the target, leaving them unable to think clearly, which incapacitates
the use of spells or powers.  This power is rightly feared by spellcasters
all over the realms.

Non-specialized mages cannot cast this spell.

Topic: misdirection  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: misdirection
Class: mage L2, bard L2
Sphere: illusion
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> misdirection on <alignment>

This spell allows a skilled illusionist to weave an aura of misdirection
around them, preventing the use of alignment discerning spells and
abilities upon them. They can appear to be any alignment of their choosing.
There are, naturally, ways to bypass this spell's protection, but it offers
a degree of deception unavailable to most wizards.

The choices for alignment are lawful good, neutral good, chaotic good,
lawful neutral, true neutral, chaotic neutral, lawful evil, neutral evil,
or chaotic evil.

Non-specialized mages cannot cast this spell.

Topic: mind_veil  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: mind veil
Class: warlock L3
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> mind veil

This invocation conjures a shroud of magical energy about the caster, which
will oppose all devices and spells that detect, influence or read emotions
or thoughts. Mind-effecting spells will not work against the warlock, and
basic divination attempts such as alignment will reveal nothing of note.
Greater divinations, such as scrying, will be opposed with by caster's own
magical strength. This invocation does not work in conjunction with other
alignment-altering effects, nor with other scry protection magics.

Topic: mire_the_mind  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: mire the mind
Class: warlock L3
Saving throw: will
Syntax: cast <classname> mire the mind

The caster creates a chilling aura around themselves, which insinuates
itself into the minds of nearby foes, should they not have the willpower to
resist. It will apply itself as a fog upon their thoughts, slowing their
combat reactions considerably. Creatures with only a single attack will not
be able to be slowed further.

*spells

Spell: magic vestments
Class: cleric L4
Sphere: conjuration_summoning
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> magic vestments

Calling for a blessing from their deity, the cleric can recieve magical
vestments that will protect them for a time.  The spell will not work if
the priest is wearing any form of armor on their torso, including leather,
chain, and armour types.  The magical vestments will grow in strength as
the priest's power grows, as will the duration.  The vestments are meant
only for the cleric, and can not be given to another.  To do so usually
brings about the wrath of their god upon the priest.

Topic: oak_body  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: oak body
Class: psywarrior L5, psion L7
Sphere: alteration
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> oak body

By using this power, the psionic character lends some of his psychic energy
to protect himself. It causes the manifester to gain some resistance to
physical attacks, as well as immunity to most standard poisons. The oaken
nature of the power leaves the manifester vulnerable to fire attacks. The
oaken body brings a minor bonus to strength at the cost of dexterity. This
power does not work together with Stoneskin or Iron Body.

This power, when manifested, will cause the psion to gather his energy,
focusing on the target.  The psion will then reach out, attempting to touch
the target.  Should he succeed, he will empathically deliver damage to the
target, while healing his own wounds for the same amount.  Note: The psion
cannot gain extra hit points through this power.  He simply heals what he
has already lost.

Topic: prying_eyes  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: prying eyes
Class: mage L9
Sphere: divination
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> prying eyes on <target>

The pinnacle of ability for a skilled diviner, this spell allows the caster
to watch and listen in upon a distant person without the need for
components or a mirror. Or, they may focus upon their surroundings and then
depart, keeping watch over it in their absence. Many such magi couple this
with their clairvoyance skills to gain both close and long-range sight of
the target, as this spell does not show anything beyond the scope of its
immediate target. The caster will need to rest after attempting this kind
of spell, before re-attempting it again.

Non-specialized mages cannot cast this spell. This spell can only be cast
while at peace.

Topic: psionic_teleport  	shadowgate System Help 	Category:
*spells

Spell: psionic teleport
Class: psion L5
Sphere: alteration
Discipline: nomad
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> psionic teleport to <location>

This power will move the nomad from his current location to one he has
previously memorized.  The nomad merely concentrates, setting his sights on
the place he would like to be, and his mind manipulates time and space to
place him there.  An example of the power's usage is <remember here as
cave>.  Then later on, the nomad would type, <cast psion psionic teleport
to cave>.  Again, you may also <unremember cave> to forget that particular
location. Note: The teleport power is not guaranteed, and the nomad may end
up in a place he did not intend.

Syntax: cast <classname> produce flame on <target>

The druid opens his hand, palm up, and a flame as bright as a torch appears
there.  The flame will not harm the druid or his equipment, but when the
druid hurls the flame at an enemy, it explodes, fanning out to damage those
around him.  Although the druid will try to control the spell so as not to
damage allies, this may not always be possible.

Spell: phase door
Class: psion L7
Sphere: alteration
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> phase door on <direction>

Manifesting this power allows a psion to teleport a short distance away.
The power can be used in combat and will ignore mundane impediments, such
as caltrops or closed doors, but will be barred by magically sealed doors.
During the short time the psion is away from this plane, he regains a small
amount of health and power points. Because it requires so much
concentration, the psion must rest a short time before manifesting this
power again. Should the psion be visible when this spell is manifested, a
shimmering prismatic light accompanies his movements.

Topic: planar_beacon  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: planar beacon
Class: mage L6
Sphere: conjuration_summoning

Syntax: cast <classname> planar beacon on <target>

This spell pinpoints a foe, regardless of what plane they are on, making
them glow like a beacon within the weave. They can then attempt to draw
this beacon to their current location. However, a foe with the strength of
mind to resist may cause the spell to backfire, instead sending the caster
to his or her target. Once this spell is used, the caster must rest for a
short while before attempting its use again.

Non-specialized mages cannot cast this spell.

*spells

Spell: psionic identify
Class: psywarrior L2, psion L2
Sphere: divination
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> psionic identify on <object>

This power allows a psion to attune his mind, focusing on the moment of an
item's creation.  The psion then reveals what he has found, marking the
enchantment of the item as well as the name, should the item have a
specific one.  The psion does not know how an item is created using these
means; he simply knows what the lasting effect is.  The item must be in the
psion's hands or on the floor for the spell to work.

NOTE: Anyone in the same room with you will also know the enchantment of
that item.

Topic: planar_portal  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: planar portal
Class: psion L9
Sphere: alteration
Discipline: nomad
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> planar portal to <location>

This potent power enables a nomad to open up a portal, allowing beings to
pass from the place he currently stands to one he has locked firmly in his
memory.  By using this power, the nomad commands a temporary connection
between the two locations.  The power is taxing, however, so the portal
will not remain open very long.  An example of the power's usage is
<remember here as cave>.  Then later on, the nomad would type, <manifest
planar portal to cave>.  Again, you may also <unremember cave> to forget
that particular location.

Topic: resurrection  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: resurrection
Class: cleric L9
Sphere: healing
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> resurrection on <target> (dead player's name)

Praying to their diety for a miracle, a priest can attempt to resurrect a
slain ally back to life.  The resurrection, if successful, will restore the
corpse back to life and full of health.  The spell is somewhat draining on
the priest, for channeling large ammounts of divine power can be
exhausting.  The target will suffer significantly less (lower exp. loss)
from the death due to the intervention of the priest.

Topic: rage  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: rage
Class: cleric L7
Sphere: combat
Domain: animal
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> rage

This spell will enrage the caster, making him stronger and more deadly in
combat for the duration.  The strength of the caster's deity and a blessed
speed result in blind fighting and reckless fearlessness. This spell does
not work in conjunction with similar magical effects, such as rally,
berserker, haste, transformation, dance of a thousand cuts, or fell flight.

Note: Being enraged means that you are maddened uncontrollably.  This is
*not* a state in which you can calmly participate in a normal conversation,
undertake delicate tasks, solve problems, or pretty much do anything other
than shout obscenities and kill things. This spell does not work in
conjunction with similar magical effects, such as rally, rage, haste and
fell flight.

Please bear in mind that when you use the spell you are also expected to
roleplay it.

*spells

Spell: remote view trap
Class: psion L6
Sphere: divination
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> remote view trap

When manifesting this power, the psion attunes his mind to the detection of
magical and psionic abilities that attempt to scry him in some form.  The
power remains strong in the psion's mind, allowing him to move and retain
concentration on the power.

Should someone attempt to scry a psion while he has this power manifested,
a battle of wills and strength ensues.  The psion's latent psychic energy
will lash out at the one scrying him, causing damage.  The struggle then
continues, and if the psion wins, he immediately knows the description and
general location of the scryer.

Should the psion's will prove more powerful than the scryer's, this power
will likewise prevent the viewer from observing the psion.

Topic: remote_viewing  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: remote viewing
Class: psion L5
Sphere: divination
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> remote viewing on <object> (a crystal ball or
equivalent)

By means of this power, the psion changes a normal crystal ball or mirror
into a scrying device. The details of the use of such a scrying device can
be accessed by typing <help crystal ball> after a successful cast on a
crystal ball.  You will be able to scry a player character or a location
with the scrying device made by this power.

The crystal ball or mirror used must be of finely polished crystal of a
minimum cost of 1,000 gp - such ones are generally found only in psion
enclaves as they are both large and fragile, making them impossible to
carry around.

You will not be able to scry a character that you have not recognized
previously with the 'recognize' command.  Your chance of success in using
the crystal ball on a character is less if you recognize someone as
something other than their true name, but its better than nothing.  You may
not scry locations at all unless they are in memory via the remember
command.

There is also a chance that the target of the power may notice that they
are being scryed.  This depends on their class, and is adjusted
significantly by intelligence, and operates independantly of any scry
detection magic or devices.

Components, psion: banded amethyst x1, blue lace agate x1, sodalite x1, red
jasper x1

Spell: raise dead
Class: cleric L5, druid L4
Sphere: healing
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> raise dead on <target> (dead player's name)

This spell will revive a dead player when cast upon their corpse.  The
deceased will be returned to the site of death and revived.  Note it is
similar to being revived in a church as the person will be barely alive and
need significant healing.  The target will suffer somewhat less from the
death (lower exp. loss) due to the intervention of the priest.

Topic: snare  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: snare
Class: druid L3, ranger L2
Sphere: conjuration_summoning
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> snare

In casting this spell, the ranger sets a snare in the location, which will
harm the first bypasser to trigger it. Anyone already present when the
spell is cast will be aware of the snare, and may come and go without
disturbing it. Additionally, thieves have a chance to actively search for
the snare and can remove it, but they must do so in the room before the
trapped location or they will trigger it.

The caster's attunement to the wilds will alert them when their snare is
tripped.  They may only rig one snare at a time, but do not need to remain
with it for it to function.  Snares can only be set in natural
surroundings.

Through this spell the caster attunes themselves with a nearby shadow and
steps into it, allowing near instantaneous travel to another destination of
their choice. A great deal of concentration is required to enact such a
spell, so the spell can be easily disrupted by others. Teleport warding
effects that are of greater strength than the caster, will thwart the spell
entirely.

Topic: spell_turning  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: spell turning
Class: mage L7
Sphere: abjuration
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> spell turning

The most skilled of abjurationists can use such a spell to raise a
protective ward around themselves. While it holds, it will have a chance to
reflect any spells which are directly aimed at the caster, regardless of
whether they are hostile or friendly. The ward will not reflect splash
damage or AOE, but only direct-targetted spells. This spell does not stack
with the 'reflection' or 'spell reflection' feats.

Non-specialized mages cannot cast this spell.

Components, mage: glass rod x1, small silver mirror x1 (or nil w. eschew
materials)

Topic: screen  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: screen
Class: cleric L6, mage/sorc L8
Sphere: illusion
Domain: illusion
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> screen

Upon casting this spell, the user creates a screen of illusion centered
upon himself that makes scrying attempts difficult.  This spell has a
chance to both detect and block scrying attempts, with the chance for
success determined by the level of the priest against the level of the
scryer.  The spell is centered upon the caster and will move with him,
allowing him to sweep areas for the duration of the spell.

When a scrying attempt is detected, the scryer must immediately roll a
saving throw.  If this is failed, the appearance and general location of
the scryer immediately become known to the one who cast this spell.  The
general location is the room and area where the scryer is located at the
time.

This spell can only be cast while at peace.

Topic: shocking_grasp  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: shocking grasp
Class: mage L1
Sphere: invocation_evocation
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> shocking grasp on <target>

This spell allows the mage to generate a small electrical charge in their
fingertips. They may then attempt to touch a foe, discharging it into them
in a powerful shock. A caster will find it far easier to contact a foe who
is carrying or wearing metal items, which will conduct the charge. While
this spell can, at first, be considerably more painful than other spells of
its sphere, a mage can only withhold so much charge in his fingertips, so
it will not take a great deal of study before the spell reaches its highest
potential.

Non-specialized mages cannot cast this spell.

Spell: spellstaff
Class: druid L6
Sphere: invocation_evocation
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> spellstaff on <spell name> | <arguments to the
spell>

NOTE: You must carry a staff with you when casting this spell.

This spell allows the druid to hold a spell in reserve to be called upon at
a later time by typing <now>.  If the spell normally requires a target,
that target will automatically be the druid.  If you need to add arguments
to the reserved spell, you must add them at the time of casting spellstaff.

example of usage:  cast spellstaff on word of recall | <remembered location>
Note: You do need the | symbol if the spell requires arguments, such as a
location.

Topic: scorcher  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: scorcher
Class: mage/sorc L2
Sphere: invocation_evocation
Saving throw: reflex
Syntax: cast <classname> scorcher on <target>

When a mage casts this ferocious spell, fire blazes out of the caster's
hand towards a target, burning through all in the way.  The mage will make
an effort to aim at only attackers, but this is not always possible. While
the spell will reliably hit the primary target, a quick opponent may avoid
being caught by the worst of the flame's edges. A versatile arcanist can
manipulate the base element of this spell.

the form of a massive wave that is directed at the target.  The wave may
knock the target down as well as force him to drop his weapons.  The force
of the water may also keep him from moving until he regains his senses. 
Because of the size of the wave, nearby targets may be hit as well.

will move the caster to the location specified.  Be warned, however.  This
powerful spell of teleport is not always without error.  The caster may end
up far from where he/she intended to teleport to. You may also <unremember
location> which will remove a specific location from memory.

Topic: transformation  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: transformation
Class: mage/sorc L6
Sphere: alteration
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> transformation

An experienced mage can use this spell to reshape their own body into a
powerful fighting machine. It adds extensive physical prowess to the
caster, as well as a degree of resilience, but comes at a price - while
active, the mage will be unable to concentrate enough to use offensive
spells. This spell does not work alongside similarly powerful melee spells,
such as rage, dance of a thousand cuts, or cunning insight.

Components, mage/sorc: fur x1, dung scrapings x1

Spell: the dead walk
Class: warlock L2
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> the dead walk (on <target>)

This invocation draws upon the power of the Plane of Shadows, infusing the
recently dead with negative energy to reanimate their bodies as undead. You
can raise a total number of hit dice worth of zombies and skeletons up to
your casting level.  They will follow you and defend you from your enemies.
Unlike most common summoning spells, these monsters will not go away unless
the caster quits.  They are undead, so they can be turned, and so forth,
but they cannot be dispelled.

Topic: timestop  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: timestop
Class: mage L9, bard L6
Sphere: alteration
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> timestop

This spell allows the transmuter to alter their immediate surroundings into
a state of such forced suspension that it would seem that time had stopped
for all but the caster.  This allows them to act normally while their
opponents can only watch, and will drop them out of direct combat. Foes
will force their way out of the spell after a brief interval, while the
very strongest of opponents may manage to resist the effect entirely.

Non-specialized mages cannot cast this spell.

Topic: truevenom  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: truevenom
Class: psywarrior L4
Sphere: combat
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> truevenom on <weapon>

Upon using this power, the psionic character manifests a powerful poison to
coat his weapon. A target struck by the poisoned weapon will suffer the
same fate as any individual struck by the physical poisons found in the
world. This power allows the psionic character to manifest more powerful
poisons than those conjured by Prevenom. Once the poison has been applied,
a corrosive layer of ectoplasm remains, inflicting extra damage on the
psionic character's enemies for a short time.

NOTE: When using this power, you must specify a weapon as the target. The
first such weapon in your inventory will be chosen, and items in containers
will be ignored.

Spell: unravel psionics

Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> unravel psionics [on <target>] or cast <classname>
unravel psionics on break curse

Unravel psionics is the most potent disruptive power in the psion's
arsenal. It can be used to destroy enchantments, summonings, and
conjurations. Like its arcane counterpart, the chances of each dispelling
depends on both the dispeller's casting level and the power level of the
spellcaster that created whatever is being dispelled. If this power targets
a particular item, it will attempt to remove any curses on the item,
similar to the break curse spell.

the caster's hand to the desired point of effect, where a sphere forms. 
The sphere drains the essence of life from the targets in the area of
effect.  The sphere does damage based on the alignment of the caster with
respect to the target.

NOTE: This spell will damage all attackers regardless of alignment, but the
damage will very if the attackers are players based on each individual's
alignment.  The damage done to mobs is consistent no matter the mob's
alignment.

This spell, when cast, will allow the mage to drain a certain amount of hit

Spell: voice of madness
Class: warlock L1
Saving throw: will
Syntax: cast <classname> voice of madness on <target>

This invocation will call upon beings beyond, unfathomable and terrifying,
to whisper in the ears of the target. A weak-willed target will become
overwhelmed by the maddening voices, and may babble incoherently, attack
the closest thing to them, or simply wander away.  When used on a player,
it simply causes them to stand and stare blankly.

Spell: vitriolic blast
Class: warlock L3
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: <blasttype vitriolic>

An eldritch blast with this essence applied will bypass all magic
resistance and AC of the target, unerringly finding its mark. It will cause
acidic residue to burn the target/s for further damage over several rounds.
Subsequent eldritch blasts will not stack this effect, but will refresh its
duration. This essence will also change the base type of the blast to acid.

Topic: walk_unseen  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: walk unseen
Class: warlock L2
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> walk unseen

This invocation places illusory spellcraft around the warlock, deceiving
the eyes of those around so as to effectively disappear from view. While
minor, a small degree of concentration is required to maintain the effect,
so it can become wearying over time. Becoming engaged in combat is
sufficiently distracting to lose control of the concealment; also, falling
unconscious will cause the invocation to fail. Of course, the warlock can
simply forgo the concentration to <appear> at any time.

Spell: warlocks call
Class: warlock L2
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> warlocks call to <target>

This invocation allows a brief message to be sent to the target (less than
200 characters). . Doing so opens the warlock up to a response from the
target - either a message of a similarly short nature, or a harmful retort
of mental energy. If either message is too long, or either party takes more
than a minute to respond, the invocation will dissipate harmlessly. If the
target is ignoring the warlock or incapacitated in some way, the invocation
will fail.

Topic: wall_of_fire  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: wall of fire
Class: mage/sorc L4, monk L13
Sphere: invocation_evocation
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> wall of fire [on <exit>]

The spell, wall of fire, is an impressive spell for the magi indeed.  The
wizard can cast the wall around himself, protectively, or in front of an
exit, so all who pass through that exit will be scorched by the flames.  To
cast the wall around him/herself, the mage simply types <cast classname
wall of fire>.  Otherwise, the mage might type <cast classname wall of fire
on north> to damage those passing through the exit.  Be warned however, the
mage who casts this spell must keep concentration on the wall to maintain
its existence.  The mage may type <remove wall> to quench the flames. A
versatile arcanist can manipulate the base element of this spell.

Spell: witchwood step
Class: warlock L2
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> witchwood step

This invocation attunes the warlock to an element of flowing energy,
commonly that of air, water, or the chaotic fluctuations of the feywild.
Such energies will lie dormant in the caster's veins, triggering at the
next time the caster is stunned or tripped to grant them freedom from the
effect. The power of this invocation is such that the caster will need to
wait a brief period once activated before it can be cast again. It can only
be cast while at peace.

Spell: walk the planes

Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> walk the planes on <location>

This powerful invocation allows the warlock to travel along the edge of the
plane with which they bear affinity, using it as 'shortcut' of sorts to a
known destination upon the prime. Such travel will heal some of the
caster's injuries along the way, given their natural bond with that
particular plane. Any party-mates who are with the caster at the time are
considered to be willing subjects of the spell, and will travel alongside
the caster to his or her destination, if they are not pre-occupied with
combat.
