Spell: form of doom
Class: psywarrior L6
Saving throw: will
Syntax: cast <classname> form of doom

The manifester calls on the stuff of nightmares, disguising himself in a
terrifying visage of sleek, lashing tentacles. Your horrific appearance is
enough to shake the confidence of those who oppose you, while the form
bolsters you, granting you some extra strength and protection from both
physical attacks and fire-based assaults. This power does not stack with
other damage resistance spells and powers (e.g. iron body, oak body,
stoneskin, resist energy).

Components, psywarrior: larvikite x3 (or nil w. eschew materials)
