Spell: mind over energy
Class: psywarrior L6, psion L6
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> mind over energy on <type>

When manifesting this power, the psionic character strengthens her mental
defenses against certain types of energy. The manifester must choose either
fiendish (protecting her from fire, electricity, and sonic attacks) or
celestial (protecting her from cold, acid, and sonic attacks) when
manifesting the power.


Spell: reaving dispel
Class: psywarrior L6, psion L8
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> reaving dispel on <target>

This power will create a mark on the target that will attempt to dispel one
magical effect per round for the duration, causing damage with each
succcessful dispel. The duration and power are both based on the psionic
character's level.


Spell: form of doom
Class: psywarrior L6
Saving throw: will
Syntax: cast <classname> form of doom

The manifester calls on the stuff of nightmares, disguising himself in a
terrifying visage of sleek, lashing tentacles. Your horrific appearance is
enough to shake the confidence of those who oppose you, while the form
bolsters you, granting you some extra strength and protection from both
physical attacks and fire-based assaults. This power does not stack with
other damage resistance spells and powers (e.g. iron body, oak body,
stoneskin, resist energy).

Components, psywarrior: larvikite x3 (or nil w. eschew materials)
