Spell: greater stomp
Class: psywarrior L5
Sphere: combat
Saving throw: reflex
Syntax: cast <classname> greater stomp

The psionic character releases a torrent of psychic energy as she stomps
upon the earth, causing tremors to ripple throughout the area. She uses her
energy to feed the power, tripping and damaging her foes for several
rounds, provided she stays in the area. All those attacking the character
are subject to the effects of the stomp, though they do receive saving
throws.


Spell: empower weapon
Class: psywarrior L5
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> empower weapon on <weapon> as <power name> |
<arguments to the power>

NOTE: This power may only be cast into a weapon and will not function
without that weapon in your inventory. Also, the weapon can store only
helpful powers, not those used for attacks. If you find that a particular
power cannot be used when you think it should be, please bug report it.

This power allows the psionic character to hold a power in reserve to be
called upon at a later time by typing <release>.  If the power reserved
normally requires a target, that target will automatically be the
manifester.  If you need to add arguments to the reserved power, you must
add them at the time of manifesting empower weapon.

example of usage:  manifest empower weapon on sword as dimension door | home

NOTE: You do need the | symbol if the power requires arguments such as a
location.
