Spell: truevenom
Class: psywarrior L4
Sphere: combat
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> truevenom on <weapon>

Upon using this power, the psionic character manifests a powerful poison to
coat his weapon. A target struck by the poisoned weapon will suffer the
same fate as any individual struck by the physical poisons found in the
world. This power allows the psionic character to manifest more powerful
poisons than those conjured by Prevenom. Once the poison has been applied,
a corrosive layer of ectoplasm remains, inflicting extra damage on the
psionic character's enemies for a short time.

NOTE: When using this power, you must specify a weapon as the target. The
first such weapon in your inventory will be chosen, and items in containers
will be ignored.
