Spell: cunning insight
Class: warlock L4
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> cunning insight

By means of this potent invocation, the warlock imbues his body with power,
thereby expanding his awareness and ability to resist and react to outside
forces. This results in an improved command of physical combat and weapon
handling, as well as a better aptitude at avoiding attacks. This invocation
does not work alongside similarly powerful melee spells, such as rage,
dance of a thousand cuts, or transformation.


Spell: infernal rain
Class: warlock L4
Saving throw: reflex
Syntax: cast <classname> infernal rain

This invocation unleashes a storm of hellfire, raining down the wrath of
infernal energies upon the warlock's foes.  The invocation will last
several rounds depending upon the level of the warlock, and the warlock
must remain present for the storm to continue.  All those attacking the
warlock are subject to the effects of the infernal rain, though they do
receive saving throws. Only one area spell or invocation may be maintained
by a caster at a time!

Only a hellfire warlock may harness this invocation.


Spell: eldritch burst
Class: warlock L4
Saving throw: reflex
Syntax: cast <classname> eldritch burst

This is the pinnacle of the core spell-like ability of the warlock - the
ability to invoke pure planar energy and hurl it at a foe. Unlike its
primary form, the invocation emits in a burst from the caster, striking any
foe within reach. As this is not a ray, no touch attack is required, but
foes can attempt a reflex save to avoid part of the damage. As with the
eldritch blast, it can be imbued with various essences.

Spell: casters lament
Class: warlock L4
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> casters lament (on <object> [at <player>])

This invocation harnesses the greatest of a warlock's natural aptitude for
manipulating magical energies and items. For the first, if cast with no
target, it will imbue the warlock with a considerable resistance to magical
attacks. If directed at an item, either in the caster's own inventory or in
that of another player, it can be used to shatter the magic upon a cursed
item.


Spell: cloak of shadows
Class: warlock L4, monk L11
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> cloak of shadows on <vision|divination>

This invocation allows the warlock to draw a curtain of shadow energy
around him, concealing him from normal and magical detection attempts. It
can be used in two ways, though only one at a time. If cast on vision, it
will generate a more powerful magical concealment than standard
invisibility - it does not require the same direct concentration to
maintain, and so it does not fail if combat is initiated. If cast on
divination, it will potentially deflect magical divination attempts to
locate or watch the caster from a distance. If invisible, the caster can
simply forgo his concentration to <step> from the shadows, or with either
type of casting, it can simply be dispelled. Both effects can only be
centred upon the caster.


Spell: utterdark blast
Class: warlock L4
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: <blasttype utterdark>

An eldritch blast with this essence applied will be empowered for greater
damage to its target/s.
See also: <help blasttype>.


Spell: binding blast
Class: warlock L4
Saving throw: will
Syntax: <blasttype binding>

An eldritch blast with this essence applied will ensnare the target/s with
magical energy, temporarily stunning them.
See also: <help blasttype>.


Spell: devour magic
Class: warlock L4
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> devour magic [on <target>]

This invocation bears greater potency than its lesser cousin, voracious
dispelling. In a similar fashion, it will attempt to destroy any spell
enchantments, magical summonings, and anything conjured.  The chances of
each dispelling depends on both the dispeller's casting level and the power
level of the spellcaster that created whatever is being dispelled, whether
it be an enchantment, summoning, or conjuration. Unlike similar abilities,
however, any spells that are successfully opposed are instead consumed by
the invocation and used to heal the warlock's injuries.


Spell: walk the planes
Class: warlock L4
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> walk the planes on <location>

This powerful invocation allows the warlock to travel along the edge of the
plane with which they bear affinity, using it as 'shortcut' of sorts to a
known destination upon the prime. Such travel will heal some of the
caster's injuries along the way, given their natural bond with that
particular plane. Any party-mates who are with the caster at the time are
considered to be willing subjects of the spell, and will travel alongside
the caster to his or her destination, if they are not pre-occupied with
combat.
