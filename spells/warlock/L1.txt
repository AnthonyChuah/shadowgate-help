Spell: detect magic
Class: cleric L1, druid L1, warlock L1, mage/sorc L1, bard L1
Sphere: divination
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> detect magic

Will allow the caster to view an aura of magic around objects or creatures
they observe. The more intense the aura the more magic is indicated.
Particularly powerful magic may skew the view of other magics. For example
an especially magical creature might skew the view of the magic sword its
wielding.


Spell: eldritch claws
Class: warlock L1
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> eldritch claws [on one hand]

A variant on the core spell-like ability of the warlock, this invocation
allows the caster to shape their eldritch blast into as many claws as they
have free hands, all of which can be used as melee weapons. If the warlock
has no free hands, the invocation will fail entirely; similarly, if a
different shaped eldritch ability is invoked, the claw/s will disappear.
Releasing grip upon a claw will cause it to disappear. As with eldritch
blast, the claw/s can be imbued with various essences; however as the
invocation is essentially a single shaping of the warlock's eldritch
ability, so only one essence may be harnessed at a time even between two
claws.

Spell: eldritch blast
Class: warlock L1
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> eldritch blast on <target>

This is the core spell-like ability of the warlock - the ability to invoke
pure planar energy and hurl it at a foe. As it is cast as a ray, it
requires a successful ranged touch attack to hit, and is subject to the
usual restrictions of spells and spell-like abilities (eg/ magic
resistance). While initially unremarkable, an accomplished warlock can
learn to reshape such a blast, or to imbue it with various essences.

Spell: entropic warding
Class: warlock L1
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> entropic warding

The caster invokes chaotic energies into a field around their person, which
makes it harder to discern their exact location. This may cause physical
blows to miss them entirely. The shield has the added effect of preventing
any trail being left in their wake, either by footfall or by scent.


Spell: glacial blast
Class: warlock L1
Saving throw: fort
Syntax: <blasttype glacial>

An eldritch blast with this essence applied will cause the target/s to
become chilled for 10min, which will inflict a penalty to their dexterity.
Subsequent eldritch blasts will not stack this effect, but will refresh its
duration. This essence will also change the base type of the blast to cold.

Spell: leaps and bounds
Class: warlock L1
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> leaps and bounds

This invocation grants the caster a startling degree of agility and
stamina. It grants a bonus to both the athletics and endurance skills for
its duration.


Spell: see the unseen
Class: warlock L1
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> see the unseen

This invocation allows a warlock to magically augment their vision,
allowing vastly improved sight in areas of extreme light or darkness, as
well as the ability to perceive hidden items and beings.


Spell: frightful blast
Class: warlock L1
Saving throw: will
Syntax: <blasttype frightful>

An eldritch blast with this essence applied will cause the target/s to
become shaken for 1min. This will inflict a penalty to their attack rolls,
saving throws, and skill checks. Subsequent eldritch blasts will not stack
this effect, but will refresh its duration.
See also: <help blasttype>.


Spell: spiderwalk
Class: warlock L1
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> spiderwalk

A warlock uses this basic invocation to capture the nature of a spider,
including their ability to climb sheer surfaces, and their immunity to
webs.


Spell: voice of madness
Class: warlock L1
Saving throw: will
Syntax: cast <classname> voice of madness on <target>

This invocation will call upon beings beyond, unfathomable and terrifying,
to whisper in the ears of the target. A weak-willed target will become
overwhelmed by the maddening voices, and may babble incoherently, attack
the closest thing to them, or simply wander away.  When used on a player,
it simply causes them to stand and stare blankly.
