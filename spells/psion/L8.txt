Spell: recall death
Class: psion L8
Sphere: alteration
Saving throw: will
Syntax: cast <classname> recall death on <target>

This spell parts the fabric of time, revealing wounds your foe has received
in the past (or is yet to receive) that are potentially fatal. That target
takes considerable damage as the past (or future) impinges briefly on the
present.


Spell: fold space
Class: psion L8
Sphere: alteration
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> fold space to <location>

This power will move the psion from his current location to one he has
previously memorized.  The psion merely concentrates, setting his sights on
the place he would like to be, and his mind manipulates time and space to
place him there.  An example of the power's usage is <remember here as
cave>.  Then later on, the psion would type, <cast psion fold space to
cave>.  Again, you may also <unremember cave> to forget that particular
location.
This spell must be cast while at peace.

Spell: mindnet
Class: cleric L9, psion L8
Sphere: divination
Discipline: telepath
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> mindnet to <target>

This power is otherwise known as mass telepathy. It will allow the psion to
open a telepathy spell with more than one target at the same time.  Each
target will be able to 'hear' the thoughts of the other targets in the
mindnet.  The mindnet takes the game mechanic form of a line in the name
that the caster has themselves recognized as.

The actual name of the line is not considered to be IC information, but
rather a mechanical method by which to facilitate the spell. The caster
must cast the spell multiple times to add more targets to the spell, and
each time they cast the spell on a new target, that target is added to the
existing mind link.  It is possible for a person to be in two or more
mindnets at the same time, but it is not possible for one caster to have
two seperate mindnet spells under their control at the same time. The
caster may remove a person from the mindnet at any time by using <mindnet
remove target>.
