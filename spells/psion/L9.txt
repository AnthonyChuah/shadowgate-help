Spell: planar portal
Class: psion L9
Sphere: alteration
Discipline: nomad
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> planar portal to <location>

This potent power enables a nomad to open up a portal, allowing beings to
pass from the place he currently stands to one he has locked firmly in his
memory.  By using this power, the nomad commands a temporary connection
between the two locations.  The power is taxing, however, so the portal
will not remain open very long.  An example of the power's usage is
<remember here as cave>.  Then later on, the nomad would type, <manifest
planar portal to cave>.  Again, you may also <unremember cave> to forget
that particular location.

Spell: timeless body
Class: psion L9
Sphere: combat
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> timeless body

This power will enable a psion to take on a ghostly state, making him
difficult to hit in combat.  The power has an equal chance each round to
make the psion untouchable or not.  The psion's body fades, becoming
partially on this plane and partially on the Astral Plane.


Spell: tornado blast
Class: psion L9
Sphere: invocation_evocation
Discipline: kineticist
Saving throw: reflex
Syntax: cast <classname> tornado blast on <target>

This power enables a kineticist to draw upon his knowledge of energy to
create a whirling vortex in the area.  The vortex is directed at the
target, who suffers a chance to be knocked down and lose anything he might
be holding.  Others in the area may also be tossed about by the winds,
suffering serious harm.

Components, psion: smoky quartz x1, blue calcite x1 (or nil w. eschew

Spell: unravel psionics
Class: psion L9
Sphere: abjuration
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> unravel psionics [on <target>] or cast <classname>
unravel psionics on break curse

Unravel psionics is the most potent disruptive power in the psion's
arsenal. It can be used to destroy enchantments, summonings, and
conjurations. Like its arcane counterpart, the chances of each dispelling
depends on both the dispeller's casting level and the power level of the
spellcaster that created whatever is being dispelled. If this power targets
a particular item, it will attempt to remove any curses on the item,
similar to the break curse spell.


Spell: microcosm
Class: psion L9
Sphere: conjuration_summoning
Saving throw: will
Syntax: cast <classname> microcosm on <target>

When a psion manifests microcosm, he affects the target's mind to make him
feel as though he is happily in a world of his own, effectively rendering
the target utterly helpless.  The success of the power depends upon the
might of the psion against the target's hardiness.
