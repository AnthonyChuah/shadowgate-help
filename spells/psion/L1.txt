Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> clairvoyance on <target>

A skilled seer can attempt to gain a brief image of a target. All they will

nearby. Anti-scrying effects will block this spell.

powerful psionic casters will need to rest between castings. This spell can
only be cast while at peace.

Spell: control object
Class: psion L1
Sphere: alteration
Discipline: kineticist
Saving throw: will
Syntax: cast <classname> control object on <room> || <target>

This power can be used in two different ways. If cast on a room, the
psionic character draws forth matter from the Material Plane, which
coalesces into debris that protects the caster. Once per round, a piece of
debris will strike a random attacker, causing damage but destroying the
debris in the process.

If cast on a target, this power functions like animate object. Some
non-magical items in the target's inventory will be animated and fall under
the caster's command. To command the objects, simply use <command objects
to [command]>. Forcing an object to do something will affect your alignment
when appropriate. 

Enchanted objects cannot be animated. Objects will take damage in combat
and may be destroyed.  The objects will remain animated until the power
ends or you <dismiss objects>.

There is a level effect that limits how large or how many objects you can
animate.
