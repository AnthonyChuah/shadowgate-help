Spell: remote view trap
Class: psion L6
Sphere: divination
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> remote view trap

When manifesting this power, the psion attunes his mind to the detection of
magical and psionic abilities that attempt to scry him in some form.  The
power remains strong in the psion's mind, allowing him to move and retain
concentration on the power.

Should someone attempt to scry a psion while he has this power manifested,
a battle of wills and strength ensues.  The psion's latent psychic energy
will lash out at the one scrying him, causing damage.  The struggle then
continues, and if the psion wins, he immediately knows the description and
general location of the scryer.

Should the psion's will prove more powerful than the scryer's, this power
will likewise prevent the viewer from observing the psion.
