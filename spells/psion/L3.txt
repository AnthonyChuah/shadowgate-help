Spell: energy cone
Class: psion L3
Sphere: invocation_evocation
Discipline: kineticist
Saving throw: reflex
Syntax: cast <classname> energy cone on <target> as <type>

Similar to energy bolt, this cone is a specialized version manifested by
kineticists.  Unlike energy bolt, this cone strikes nearby targets as well,
giving the kineticist additional power in battles against multiple enemies.

Class: psion L3
Sphere: illusion
Discipline: egoist
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> chameleon

Chameleon allows an egoist to cover himself with a thin sheen of ectoplasm
that he then wills to blend in perfectly with his surroundings.  This
renders the egoist invisible to all eyes (except those enchanted to see
invisible beings, of course).  Because of the nature of the power, the
egoist may attack while in this state, though the power has a chance to
drain from him every time he moves.

a crackling field that can harm attackers.  Once each round, the psion
automatically lashes out at one of his foes, striking him with energy.  The
duration of this power grows with the psion.
