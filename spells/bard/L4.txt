Spell: cleanse disease
Class: cleric L4, paladin L4, druid L3, ranger L3, bard L4
Sphere: healing
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> cleanse disease on <target>

This spell will attempt to cleanse any diseases present on the <target>.
Success is based on the level of the caster versus the difficult of the
particular disease.


Spell: heroism
Class: mage L3, bard L4
Sphere: enchantment_charm
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> heroism (on <target>)

This spell allows the caster to draw upon their personal presence and
charm, granting them or an ally a bonus to morale on attacks, saves and
core skills. It does not stack with other morale-boosting spells, such as
good hope.

Non-specialized mages cannot cast this spell.

Components, mage: vermilion x2 (or nil w. eschew materials)
Components, bard: ballad x1 (or nil w. eschew materials)

Spell: detect scrying
Class: mage/sorc L4, bard L4
Sphere: divination
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> detect scrying

By means of this spell, the wizard immediately becomes aware of any attempt
to observe him by means of clairvoyance, clairaudience, or magic mirror. 
This also reveals the use of crystal balls or other magical scrying
devices, provided the attempt is within the area of effect of the spell. 
Since the spell is centered on the spellcaster, it moves with him, enabling
him to 'sweep' areas for the duration of the spell.

When a scrying attempt is detected, the scryer must immediately roll a
saving throw.  If this is failed, the appearance and general location of
the scryer immediately become known to the wizard who cast this spell. The
general location is the room and area where the scryer is located at the
time.

This spell does not protect from scrying, however.  Despite the fact that
you have detected the scrying, you cannot end the scrying without casting a
spell or using an object that protects from scrying.

Components, mage/sorc: tiny hearing trumpet x1, piece of mirror x1
Components, bard: rhyme x1 (or nil w. eschew materials)

Spell: break curse
Class: cleric L8, paladin L3, mage/sorc L5, bard L4
Sphere: abjuration
Domain: magic
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> break curse on <object> [at <player>]

This powerful spell will break a curse that has been placed upon a magical
item, unravelling the corrupted weave around it.  Only the most skilled of
abjurers can attempt to disentangle enchantments in such a manner.

Sorcerers and non-specialized mages cannot cast this spell.

Components, mage: powdered diamond x2
Components, bard: hymn x3

Spell: secure shelter
Class: bard L4
Sphere: alteration
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> secure shelter

When this spell is cast, it conjures a small pocket dimension under the
guise of a little house, secure and impervious to outside forces.  It
offers temporary safety from the outside world.  To cast, a narrative
reciting details of the cottage you are trying to summon, is required.

Components, bard: narrative x1 (or nil w. eschew materials)

Spell: shout
Class: mage/sorc L4, bard L4
Sphere: enchantment_charm
Saving throw: fort
Syntax: cast <classname> shout on <target>

This spell allows for the mage to magically enchant and enhance her voice,
to deliver a strong sonic attack against one target.  The amplified voice
can knock some targets off balance for a moment, forcing them to spend some
time for the ringing in their ears to pass.


Spell: dimension door
Class: psywarrior L4, psion L4, bard L4
Sphere: alteration
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> dimension door to <location>

Through this spell the caster opens a 'door' in the fabric of reality,
attuned only to themselves.  They can use this to step through to a
location of their choice, only one that they have previously visited and
found to resonate with their soul.  A great deal of concentration is
required to enact such a spell, so the spell can be easily disrupted by
others.  Teleport warding effects that are of greater strength than the
caster, will thwart the spell entirely.
