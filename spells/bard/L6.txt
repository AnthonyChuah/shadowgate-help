Spell: greater shout
Class: mage/sorc L8, bard L6
Sphere: enchantment_charm
Saving throw: fort
Syntax: cast <classname> greater shout on <target>

Like shout, greater shout allows for the mage to magically enchant and
enhance his voice, to deliver a devastating sonic attack against one
target, but with more power added to his voice through the use of the
enchantments of this spell.  The amplified voice can knock some targets off
balance for a moment, forcing them to spend some time for the ringing in
their ears to pass.


Spell: heroes feast
Class: cleric L6, bard L6
Sphere: conjuration_summoning
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> heroes feast

This spell will allow the caster to create a huge table, filled with
delectable treats and succulent dishes.  The feast created by this prayer
will alleviate hunger and thirst, and tastes far better than the what is
provided with the create food prayer.  The feast will not last forever, so
take heed.  Also, the gods frown on those who try to steal leftovers and
save them for later.

Components, bard: ode x1 (or nil w. eschew materials)

Spell: healing circle
Class: bard L6
Sphere: healing
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> healing circle

touching all friendly targets and renewing their vitality.


Spell: animate object
Class: cleric L6, bard L6
Sphere: alteration
Saving throw: will
Syntax: cast <classname> animate object on <object> || <room>

This spell allows you to animate objects and command then.  <command
objects to command> will command the object to act as instructed.  Forcing
an object to do something will affect your alignment when appropriate.  If
you cast the spell on 'room', you will animate the objects located on the
floor of the room (non living).  If you cast it on a non-living target,
that object will become animated.  If you cast it on a living being, items
from that being's inventory will be animated.

Enchanted objects cannot be animated.  Objects will take damage in combat
and may be destroyed.  The objects will remain animated until the spell
ends or you <dismiss objects>.

There is a level effect that limits how large or how many objects you can
animate.

Components, bard: song x1

Spell: listening shadow
Class: cleric L8, bard L6
Sphere: divination

player indicated. You receive everything heard by the shadow.

Components, bard: epithet x1, rhetoric x2

Spell: project image
Class: mage L7, bard L6
Sphere: illusion
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> project image on <target>

This spell will conjure an illusionary image of the caster, which will seek
out the specified target and convey the caster's thoughts by way of its own
speech.  Likewise, it will convey the words of the target back to the
caster.  To speak to the target, the caster should use the <tell> and
<reply> commands as per telepathy effects.  Any attack upon the image will
cause it to dissipate.  You can be rid of the image with <dismiss image>.

Non-specialized mages cannot cast this spell.


Spell: timestop
Class: mage L9, bard L6
Sphere: alteration
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> timestop

This spell allows the transmuter to alter their immediate surroundings into
a state of such forced suspension that it would seem that time had stopped
for all but the caster.  This allows them to act normally while their
opponents can only watch, and will drop them out of direct combat. Foes
will force their way out of the spell after a brief interval, while the
very strongest of opponents may manage to resist the effect entirely.

Non-specialized mages cannot cast this spell.

Components, mage: quicksilver x3

Feat requirements: bard (timeweaver)
