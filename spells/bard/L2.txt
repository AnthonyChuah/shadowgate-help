Spell: alter self
Class: psywarrior L2, innate L1, psion L2, bard L2
Sphere: transmutation
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> alter self

This spell allows the caster to make minor changes to their body. These are
usually sufficient changes that they become unrecognizable even to those
they are familiar with. It does not allow for such drastic changes as body
size or overall shape; the caster would still be quite recognizable as a
creature of their race.

OOC: This spell does not alter details on your scoresheet (eyes, hair) but
the caster may describe their new form and features differently to these if
they so choose. They must still maintain their overall body shape (ie.
race, general height and weight).

You can only have one altered form with this spell - repeat uses do not
grant additional different shapeshifts, but instead return you to the same
secondary form. Adjective, description, speech, messages etc will be
remembered across castings, so they will only need to be set once in your
alternative form. Players will be able to recognise your 'other self' as a
unique entity, separate from your usual self.

is from time.  The spell will last generally a long time if left to wear
off however.  Maintaining this spell can become wearying to the caster over
