Spell: resonating word
Class: mage L7, bard L5
Sphere: alteration
Saving throw: fort
Syntax: cast <classname> resonating word on <target>

The caster uses a word of power to cause potentially lethal vibrations in
the chosen target. Its effects are only subtle to begin with, but quickly
become destructive. Those with a greater degree of fortitude may be able to
withstand the worst of its effects.

Non-specialized mages cannot cast this spell.


Spell: regeneration
Class: cleric L7, druid L9, bard L5
Sphere: healing
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> regeneration on <target>

This spell will cause the target to continuously regenerate a small amount
of health over a long period of time.  It cannot be used on the same target
more than once, and does not work in conjunction with the feat of the same
name.

Components, bard: sonnet x1 (or nil w. eschew materials)

Spell: forgotten melody
Class: cleric L7, bard L5
Sphere: enchantment_charm
Domain: knowledge
Saving throw: will
Syntax: cast <classname> forgotten melody on <target> in <language>

This spell has the caster singing the beginning of a catchy tune.  The tune
gets locked in the head of the target listeners.  This prevents them from
doing anything involving concentration due to their infatuation with the
song.  The caster does not have to continue singing, as the spell's effects
are that the targets become lost in trying to figure out the tune.


Spell: false vision
Class: bard L5
Sphere: illusion
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> false vision (on target)

This illusion is designed to foil the attempts of scrying upon the caster. 
While active, anyone scrying out the caster will have to contest their
strength.  Should they succeed, the scrying will continue as normal.  If
they fail, they will instead be met with a vision designed to touch at
their innermost fears, to disrupt their scrying attempt and encourage them
not to try again.

Components, bard: chord x1 (or nil w. eschew materials)
