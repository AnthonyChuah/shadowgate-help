Spell: hold monster
Class: cleric L4
Sphere: enchantment_charm
Saving throw: fort
Syntax: cast <classname> hold monster on <target>

This will magically hold most types of monsters.  It will hold for longer,
as your levels increase.  They will be able to hear, but not look or fight.


Spell: glyph of warding
Class: cleric L4
Sphere: conjuration_summoning
Domain: creation
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> glyph of warding

By casting this spell, the priest uses his powers of generation to create a
mystical glyph that will protect a small circle around the area in which he
stands.  The glyph will alert the caster should any creature enter the area
protected by the glyph, and it will deliver a bit of a shock to the one who
does.  Any creature already within the protected area may leave without
disturbing the glyph.  If a creature was within the glyph when it was
created, he or she may enter again without triggering the protective
response.

Typically, priests have been known to use this spell to protect areas with
treasure or to help ensure privacy.  Because the glyph generates energy
that protects a circle, it will guard all exits in a room.  However - like
a circle - when it has been breached once, the energy will dissipate, and
the spell will end.  Additionally, thieves have a chance to search out and
disable glyphs, though it does take active concentration on their part.  A
thief must make the search in the room preceding the room the glyph is
thought to be in.

A priest may concentrate on only one glyph at a time, but he does not have
to remain in the room for the glyph to remain.


Spell: magic vestments
Class: cleric L4
Sphere: conjuration_summoning
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> magic vestments

Calling for a blessing from their deity, the cleric can recieve magical
vestments that will protect them for a time.  The spell will not work if
the priest is wearing any form of armor on their torso, including leather,
chain, and armour types.  The magical vestments will grow in strength as
the priest's power grows, as will the duration.  The vestments are meant
only for the cleric, and can not be given to another.  To do so usually
brings about the wrath of their god upon the priest.
