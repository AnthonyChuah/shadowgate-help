Spell: mass heal
Class: cleric L9
Sphere: healing
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> mass heal on <target>

This is a stronger version of the priest spell, heal.  When cast without a
target or on the caster or any party member, it will heal the caster and
any party members of the caster who are present in the area.  When cast on
a hostile, it will hit all hostiles in the immediate area, healing those
that are living, and hurting those that are undead.  When cast on a neutral
creature that is neither in the caster's party or hostile to the caster, it
will hit all creatures in the area, healing those that are living and
hurting those that are undead.


Spell: resurrection
Class: cleric L9
Sphere: healing
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> resurrection on <target> (dead player's name)

Praying to their diety for a miracle, a priest can attempt to resurrect a
slain ally back to life.  The resurrection, if successful, will restore the
corpse back to life and full of health.  The spell is somewhat draining on
the priest, for channeling large ammounts of divine power can be
exhausting.  The target will suffer significantly less (lower exp. loss)
from the death due to the intervention of the priest.
