Spell: confusion
Class: cleric L7
Sphere: enchantment_charm
Domain: trickery
Saving throw: will
Syntax: cast <classname> confusion on <target>

This spell will attempt to confuse the target and make them do random
things.  They might babble incoherently, attack the closest thing to them,
or simply wander away.  When used on a player, it simply causes them to
stand and stare blankly.


Spell: flameburst
Class: cleric L7
Sphere: elemental fire
Domain: fire
Saving throw: fort
Syntax: cast <classname> flameburst on <target>

This spell will send a small ball of fire towards the target's chest.  If
the spell is successful, the ball will bury itself inside of the target's
flesh and begin to grow.  Over the next several moments, the fire will
consume the target's lungs and heart, and render them unable to move.  If
the spell is not dispelled before it has time to complete, the target's
chest will explode dealing great damage to him and anything near him.


Spell: blasphemy
Class: cleric L7
Sphere: enchantment_charm
Domain: evil
Saving throw: reflex
Syntax: cast <classname> blasphemy

This spell channels unholy magic directly to the caster and releases it at
a target in the form of a silent explosion.  Those of good hearts have the
additional chance to be blinded and/or stunned, while those of neutral bent
may be stunned briefly.


Spell: hypothermia
Class: cleric L7
Sphere: combat
Domain: cold
Saving throw: reflex
Syntax: cast <classname> hypothermia on <target>

This spell creates a freezing ray of bitter cold.  The ray will seek to
drain the heat from the target as the cold moves through his body.  Because
it is a ray, there is a chance the target can dodge some of the bitter
cold.  However, if hit with the full force of the spell, the target will
also begin to grow chilled, eventually becoming frozen and blinded for a
time.


Spell: charm monster
Class: cleric L7, bard L3
Sphere: enchantment_charm
Domain: charm
Saving throw: will
Syntax: cast <classname> charm monster on <target>

Casting this divine prayer will allow a priest to attempt to charm a mob. 
If the mob falls prey to the charm, they will stand in defense of the
caster, and follow them around.  Caution should be exercised, for if you
take any offensive actions against the charmed monster, the charm will end.
A caster may have only one charmed creature under their sway at one time.

OOC
Please exercise caution and good role-playing skills when using this
prayer.  Just because you have a monster charmed, does not mean people will
react well to it in crowded places.


Spell: berserker
Class: cleric L7
Sphere: combat
Domain: war
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> berserker

This spell will fill the caster with the rage of war, causing him to
berserk madly.  The strength of the caster's deity and a blessed speed
result in blind fighting and reckless fearlessness. This spell does not
work in conjunction with similar magical effects, such as rally, rage,
haste, transformation, dance of a thousand cuts, or fell flight.

Note: Being berserk means that you are maddened with rage.  This is *not* a
state in which you can calmly participate in a normal conversation,
undertake delicate tasks, solve problems, or pretty much do anything other
than shout obscenities and kill things.

Please bear in mind that when you use the spell you are also expected to
roleplay it.

Sphere: combat
Domain: creation

blanketing a small area.  Those within the area risk being knocked to the
ground and seared by the molten rock.


Spell: forgotten melody
Class: cleric L7, bard L5
Sphere: enchantment_charm
Domain: knowledge
Saving throw: will
Syntax: cast <classname> forgotten melody on <target> in <language>

This spell has the caster singing the beginning of a catchy tune.  The tune
gets locked in the head of the target listeners.  This prevents them from
doing anything involving concentration due to their infatuation with the
song.  The caster does not have to continue singing, as the spell's effects
are that the targets become lost in trying to figure out the tune.


Spell: regeneration
Class: cleric L7, druid L9, bard L5
Sphere: healing
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> regeneration on <target>

This spell will cause the target to continuously regenerate a small amount
of health over a long period of time.  It cannot be used on the same target
more than once, and does not work in conjunction with the feat of the same
name.

Spell: rage
Class: cleric L7
Sphere: combat
Domain: animal
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> rage

This spell will enrage the caster, making him stronger and more deadly in
combat for the duration.  The strength of the caster's deity and a blessed
speed result in blind fighting and reckless fearlessness. This spell does
not work in conjunction with similar magical effects, such as rally,
berserker, haste, transformation, dance of a thousand cuts, or fell flight.

Note: Being enraged means that you are maddened uncontrollably.  This is
*not* a state in which you can calmly participate in a normal conversation,
undertake delicate tasks, solve problems, or pretty much do anything other
than shout obscenities and kill things. This spell does not work in
conjunction with similar magical effects, such as rally, rage, haste and
fell flight.

Please bear in mind that when you use the spell you are also expected to
roleplay it.
