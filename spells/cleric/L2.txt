cloud, from which he can release a torrential surge of rain over the

difficult to retain their footing among the surge.

invisible to most viewers.  The spell likewise confers the ability to move
while invisible, so long as the caster does not pass out of the appropriate

or leave the rocky terrain.  In addition, the spell may wear off over time.

until either the aura expires or they leave the presence of the caster.
