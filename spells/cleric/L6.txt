Sphere: alteration
Domain: travel
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> pass portal on <direction>

such magic, but most are not.  If the priest is visible when casting this
spell, her movements are accompanied by a bright light.


Spell: screen
Class: cleric L6, mage/sorc L8
Sphere: illusion
Domain: illusion
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> screen

Upon casting this spell, the user creates a screen of illusion centered
upon himself that makes scrying attempts difficult.  This spell has a
chance to both detect and block scrying attempts, with the chance for
success determined by the level of the priest against the level of the
scryer.  The spell is centered upon the caster and will move with him,
allowing him to sweep areas for the duration of the spell.

When a scrying attempt is detected, the scryer must immediately roll a
saving throw.  If this is failed, the appearance and general location of
the scryer immediately become known to the one who cast this spell.  The
general location is the room and area where the scryer is located at the
time.

This spell can only be cast while at peace.

Syntax: cast <classname> animate object on <object> || <room>

floor of the room (non living).  If you cast it on a non-living target,
