Saving throw: n/a

It is not uncommon for a priest or knight to be drawn into combat to
protect her faith or deity.  For that reason the gods have blessed their
servants with a prayer that grants them a divine weapon.  Each faith has a
different weapon, some say magical copies of the favored weapons on their
patron gods.  With this spell, a divine spellcaster will create a magical
weapon in their hand.

*NOTE*
Each weapon will have a few keywords to it, but all will have the name of
the weapon and 'weapon' for purpose of wielding, unwielding, and showing it
off.
