Spell: cone of cold
Class: mage/sorc L5, monk L15
Sphere: invocation_evocation
Saving throw: reflex
Syntax: cast <classname> cone of cold on <target>

By casting this spell, you form a massive white cone of icy cold towards
your target.  Not only does this spell increase damagewise as the caster
increases in level, but also, the chance of hitting an unintended target in
addition to the intentional one increases too.  The mage will try to aim
the spell at only hostile targets, but this is not always possible.

Components, mage/sorc: crystal x1 (or nil w. eschew materials)
