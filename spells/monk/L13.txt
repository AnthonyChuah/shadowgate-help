Spell: gust of wind
Class: mage/sorc L4, monk L13

Waving a pair of specially prepared feathers in the air, the caster is able
to generate a brief but intense gust of wind.  Using his left hand, the
caster directs the damaging winds into their target.  The power of the gust
of wind is dependant on the level of the caster.

Spell: wall of fire
Class: mage/sorc L4, monk L13
Sphere: invocation_evocation
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> wall of fire [on <exit>]

The spell, wall of fire, is an impressive spell for the magi indeed.  The
wizard can cast the wall around himself, protectively, or in front of an
exit, so all who pass through that exit will be scorched by the flames.  To
cast the wall around him/herself, the mage simply types <cast classname
wall of fire>.  Otherwise, the mage might type <cast classname wall of fire
on north> to damage those passing through the exit.  Be warned however, the
mage who casts this spell must keep concentration on the wall to maintain
its existence.  The mage may type <remove wall> to quench the flames. A
versatile arcanist can manipulate the base element of this spell.

Components, mage/sorc: phosphorus x1 (or nil w. eschew materials)
