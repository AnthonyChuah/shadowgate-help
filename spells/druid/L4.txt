Spell: raise dead
Class: cleric L5, druid L4
Sphere: healing
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> raise dead on <target> (dead player's name)

This spell will revive a dead player when cast upon their corpse.  The
deceased will be returned to the site of death and revived.  Note it is
similar to being revived in a church as the person will be barely alive and
need significant healing.  The target will suffer somewhat less from the
death (lower exp. loss) due to the intervention of the priest.

Spell: dispel magic
Class: cleric L3, paladin L3, druid L4, mage/sorc L3, bard L3
Sphere: abjuration
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> dispel magic (on <target>)

Dispel Magic, when cast, will destroy any spell enchantments, any magical
summonings, and anything conjured.  The chances of each dispelling depends
on both the dispeller's casting level and the casting level of the wizard
or priest that created whatever is being dispelled, whether it be an
enchantment, summoning, or conjuration.


Spell: rusting grasp
Class: druid L4
Sphere: invocation_evocation
Saving throw: fort
Syntax: cast <classname> rusting grasp on <target>

The caster of this spell invokes the power of nature to rust metal and
cause some damage to the target.  If the target resists, then he is able to
avoid most of the damage, but if the spell hits successfully, then the
target suffers some damage and any metal objects in his inventory may also
be damaged.


Spell: flame strike
Class: cleric L5, druid L4
Sphere: combat
Saving throw: reflex
Syntax: cast <classname> flame strike on <target>

This spell will call down a pillar of flame to engulf your foes.  It can be
used in two ways - when used before combat begins, it will engulf a single
foe; when cast during combat, it is particularly devastating, as it will
severely burn up to five enemies.  Beware, the caster should advise his
allies to not stand too close to the target of the spell!


Spell: air walk
Class: druid L4
Sphere: alteration
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> air walk on <target>

This spell will allow the target to walk on the air as if it were perfectly
level ground.  This makes traveling over long distances almost effortless.
