Spell: elemental swarm
Class: druid L9
Sphere: elemental
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> elemental swarm on <target>

This spell will unleash the fury of the elemental planes on the caster's
foes.  A portal will open to a random elemental plane and an elder
elemental will come forth to aid the caster.  The elemental will fight
until it is slain or until the caster's enemies are killed.  If the
elemental is slain, another portal will open to a different elemental
plane.  This will continue until the caster is dead, until his or her foes
are all dead, or until an elemental has been called forth from each of the
planes of earth, air, fire, and water.
