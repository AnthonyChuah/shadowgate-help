Spell: divine weapon

Sphere: conjuration_summoning
Saving throw: n/a

It is not uncommon for a priest or knight to be drawn into combat to

patron gods.  With this spell, a divine spellcaster will create a magical
weapon in their hand.

Each weapon will have a few keywords to it, but all will have the name of
the weapon and 'weapon' for purpose of wielding, unwielding, and showing it
off.
