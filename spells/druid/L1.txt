Spell: produce flame
Class: druid L1
Sphere: alteration
Saving throw: reflex
Syntax: cast <classname> produce flame on <target>

The druid opens his hand, palm up, and a flame as bright as a torch appears
there.  The flame will not harm the druid or his equipment, but when the
druid hurls the flame at an enemy, it explodes, fanning out to damage those
around him.  Although the druid will try to control the spell so as not to
damage allies, this may not always be possible.
