Spell: wall of stone
Class: druid L6, mage/sorc L5, monk L9
Sphere: earth
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> wall of stone on <exit>

This command will cause a wall of rubble to appear on an exit, preventing
travel in that direction until all of the rubble has been cleared away. 
The more powerful the caster, the larger the rubble wall that must be
removed.

Spell: spellstaff
Class: druid L6
Sphere: invocation_evocation
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> spellstaff on <spell name> | <arguments to the
spell>

NOTE: You must carry a staff with you when casting this spell.

This spell allows the druid to hold a spell in reserve to be called upon at
a later time by typing <now>.  If the spell normally requires a target,
that target will automatically be the druid.  If you need to add arguments
to the reserved spell, you must add them at the time of casting spellstaff.

example of usage:  cast spellstaff on word of recall | <remembered location>
Note: You do need the | symbol if the spell requires arguments, such as a
location.



Spell: fire seeds
Class: druid L6
Sphere: fire
Saving throw: reflex
Syntax: cast <classname> fire seeds on <target>

Upon casting this spell, a druid scoops up seeds from the surrounding
wilderness and enchants them before hurling them at his foes.  The seeds
explode upon impact, burning his foes.  The druid will make an attempt to
damage only foes, but that is not always possible, and targets have a
chance to avoid the brunt of the spell for half damage.  This spell can be
cast only in the wilderness.

NOTE: If you receive a message that you cannot cast the spell in a certain
room because of the terrain and you think you received the message in
error, please <bug here> and let us know so we can see if the terrain needs
to be adjusted.
