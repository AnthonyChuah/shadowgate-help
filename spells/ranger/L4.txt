Spell: treestride
Class: druid L5, ranger L4
Sphere: alteration
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> treestride

By means of this spell, a ranger attunes themselves so closely with a tree
that they are able to step into it, using its connection with nature to
travel to the World Tree - the heart of the wilderness.

Any distractions will cause the spell to fail, as it requires deep
concentration from the caster.  This spell can only be cast while at peace.
