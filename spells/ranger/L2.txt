Spell: snare
Class: druid L3, ranger L2
Sphere: conjuration_summoning
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> snare

In casting this spell, the ranger sets a snare in the location, which will
harm the first bypasser to trigger it. Anyone already present when the
spell is cast will be aware of the snare, and may come and go without
disturbing it. Additionally, thieves have a chance to actively search for
the snare and can remove it, but they must do so in the room before the
trapped location or they will trigger it.

The caster's attunement to the wilds will alert them when their snare is
tripped.  They may only rig one snare at a time, but do not need to remain
with it for it to function.  Snares can only be set in natural
surroundings.
