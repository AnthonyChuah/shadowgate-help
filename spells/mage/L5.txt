Spell: cone of cold
Class: mage/sorc L5, monk L15
Sphere: invocation_evocation
Saving throw: reflex
Syntax: cast <classname> cone of cold on <target>

By casting this spell, you form a massive white cone of icy cold towards
your target.  Not only does this spell increase damagewise as the caster
increases in level, but also, the chance of hitting an unintended target in
addition to the intentional one increases too.  The mage will try to aim
the spell at only hostile targets, but this is not always possible.

Components, mage/sorc: crystal x1 (or nil w. eschew materials)

Spell: ball lightning
Class: mage/sorc L5
Sphere: conjuration_summoning
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> ball lightning on <target>

This spell allows for a mage to conjure forth at least three balls of
lightning, which they can then hurl at a target. As the mage's power grows,
she will find it easier to summon a greater number of lightning balls,
increasing the damage potential of the spell. A versatile arcanist can
manipulate the base element of this spell.

Spell: break curse

Domain: magic
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> break curse on <object> [at <player>]

item, unravelling the corrupted weave around it.  Only the most skilled of
abjurers can attempt to disentangle enchantments in such a manner.

Spell: domination
Class: mage/sorc L5
Sphere: enchantment_charm
Saving throw: will
Syntax: cast <classname> domination on <target>

By casting domination  successfully, you will gain control over a chosen
target.  You can order the victim to do whatever is within his/her
capability.  For example, if the caster uses <cast domination on
targetname>, targetname is the victim of the spell.  Next, the mage can use
<make targetname do kill kobold> or <make targetname emote kisses your
feet>.  The spell can be ended with <free targetname>.

**** NOTE ****
Roleplay appropriately when using this spell.  Do NOT use it for any form
of OOC harrassment.  OOC lines can be used to communicate if necessary
during the spell, as the victim will not be able to speak of their own
accord ICly.


Spell: acid breath
Class: mage/sorc L5
Sphere: alteration
Saving throw: reflex
Syntax: cast <classname> acid breath on <target>

This incantation allows for the mage to collect a pool of acid in his/her
mouth.  The magics of this spell prevent the caster from being harmed by
the acid while it is being collected.  The mage then is able to release the
acid as a breath weapon attack, the droplets of acid spinning around in a
cone.  More acid is able to be collected as the mage grows in power, making
the spell very deadly for a powerful caster.  Though it will become harder
for the mage to control the acid they stream forth, sometimes even
accidentally hitting friends or allies.

Components, mage/sorc: snakes tongue x1 (or nil w. eschew materials)

Spell: lower resistance
Class: mage/sorc L5

Spell: teleport
Class: mage/sorc L5
Sphere: alteration
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> teleport to <location>

The teleport spell will move the caster from his current location to a
specified 'remembered location'.  The remember command is used to retain a
location in the caster's memory, <remember here as cave> for example.  Then
the caster can type <cast classname teleport to cave> and the the spell
will move the caster to the location specified.  Be warned, however.  This
powerful spell of teleport is not always without error.  The caster may end
up far from where he/she intended to teleport to. You may also <unremember
location> which will remove a specific location from memory.
This spell can only be cast while at peace.
