Spell: acid breath
Class: mage/sorc L5
Sphere: alteration
Saving throw: reflex
Syntax: cast <classname> acid breath on <target>

This incantation allows for the mage to collect a pool of acid in his/her
mouth.  The magics of this spell prevent the caster from being harmed by
the acid while it is being collected.  The mage then is able to release the
acid as a breath weapon attack, the droplets of acid spinning around in a
cone.  More acid is able to be collected as the mage grows in power, making
the spell very deadly for a powerful caster.  Though it will become harder
for the mage to control the acid they stream forth, sometimes even
accidentally hitting friends or allies.

Components, mage/sorc: snakes tongue x1 (or nil w. eschew materials)

Spell: domination
Class: mage/sorc L5
Sphere: enchantment_charm
Saving throw: will
Syntax: cast <classname> domination on <target>

By casting domination  successfully, you will gain control over a chosen
target.  You can order the victim to do whatever is within his/her
capability.  For example, if the caster uses <cast domination on
targetname>, targetname is the victim of the spell.  Next, the mage can use
<make targetname do kill kobold> or <make targetname emote kisses your
feet>.  The spell can be ended with <free targetname>.

**** NOTE ****
Roleplay appropriately when using this spell.  Do NOT use it for any form
of OOC harrassment.  OOC lines can be used to communicate if necessary
during the spell, as the victim will not be able to speak of their own
accord ICly.


Spell: teleport
Class: mage/sorc L5
Sphere: alteration
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> teleport to <location>

The teleport spell will move the caster from his current location to a
specified 'remembered location'.  The remember command is used to retain a
location in the caster's memory, <remember here as cave> for example.  Then
the caster can type <cast classname teleport to cave> and the the spell
will move the caster to the location specified.  Be warned, however.  This
powerful spell of teleport is not always without error.  The caster may end
up far from where he/she intended to teleport to. You may also <unremember
location> which will remove a specific location from memory.
This spell can only be cast while at peace.
