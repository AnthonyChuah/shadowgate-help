Sphere: conjuration_summoning
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> acid arrow on <target>

When throwing a dart at a victim and casting the acid arrow spell, the dart
will turn into an acidic arrow with the aim and speed as if fired by a
fighter of the caster's spell level.  Damage will be inflicted immediately
upon hitting the target, then the acid will seep through the victim's
veins, doing more damage per combat round until the acid wears off or the
target is dead. A versatile arcanist can manipulate the base element of
this spell.

Components, mage/sorc: dart x1 (or nil w. eschew materials)

Spell: scorcher
Class: mage/sorc L2

When a mage casts this ferocious spell, fire blazes out of the caster's
hand towards a target, burning through all in the way.  The mage will make
an effort to aim at only attackers, but this is not always possible. While
the spell will reliably hit the primary target, a quick opponent may avoid
being caught by the worst of the flame's edges. A versatile arcanist can
manipulate the base element of this spell.

be trapped within a massive web for quite some time.  The time it takes for
the victim to escape varies with strength.
