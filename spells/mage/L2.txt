Class: mage/sorc L2, bard L2
Sphere: illusion
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> invisibility (on <target>)

This spell generally will let the caster turn himself or another creature
or player invisible until one of the three conditions are met.  The
invisible target has chosen to <appear> to all by typing that, the target
started a fight or was attacked, and the final way the spell would wear off
is from time.  The spell will last generally a long time if left to wear
off however.  Maintaining this spell can become wearying to the caster over
time.

materials)

Class: mage/sorc L2
Sphere: alteration
Saving throw: n/a

target is dead. A versatile arcanist can manipulate the base element of
this spell.

Sphere: divination
Discipline: seer
Saving throw: n/a

laughing, until the spell finally wears off.

materials)

hand towards a target, burning through all in the way.  The mage will make

the spell will reliably hit the primary target, a quick opponent may avoid
being caught by the worst of the flame's edges. A versatile arcanist can
manipulate the base element of this spell.
