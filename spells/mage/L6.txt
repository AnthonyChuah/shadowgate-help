Syntax: cast <classname> contingency on <spell name> (| <arguments to the
spell>)

This spell allows you to put a spell in reserve, called upon at any time
with the command <now>.  The target of the reserved spell is always the
caster, but arguments can be specified for spells that require them.  You
must carry a likeness of yourself, usually a small statue, when casting
this spell./n/nexample of usage:  cast contingency on teleport |
<remembered location>

Components, mage/sorc: eyelash of ogre-mage x1, quicksilver x1

Spell: disintegrate
Class: cleric L8, mage/sorc L6
Sphere: invocation_evocation
Domain: destruction
Saving throw: fort
Syntax: cast <classname> disintegrate on <target>

This spell sends a powerful line of destructive energy at the target.  If
the target resists, then they are able to avoid most of the damage, but if
the spell hits successfully, then the target suffers great damage and the
objects in his or her inventory may also be damaged.

Components, mage/sorc: ruby dust x1, powdered amber x2

Spell: dragon scales
Class: mage/sorc L6
Sphere: conjuration_summoning
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> dragon scales on <target>

When cast, the spell will enchant the skin of the target to become covered
in draconic scales.  The scales will last for a certain duration depending
on the caster's level, and will vanish if the person wearing them quits
out.  The scales provide an innate armor bonus that is dependant upon
level, but cannot exceed +4. Some of the innate magic resistance of the
dragon scale will also cover the caster. This will only work on those
wearing mage-like armor.

Components, mage/sorc: dragon scale x1

Spell: mind fog
Class: mage L6
Sphere: enchantment_charm
Saving throw: will
Syntax: cast <classname> mind fog on <target>

Known only to some of the most powerful enchanters of the realm, this spell
does no visible damage to the victim.  Instead, it serves to cloud the mind
of the target, leaving them unable to think clearly, which incapacitates
the use of spells or powers.  This power is rightly feared by spellcasters
all over the realms.

Non-specialized mages cannot cast this spell.

Components, mage: sapphire dust x1, diamond dust x2

Spell: planar beacon
Class: mage L6
Sphere: conjuration_summoning
Saving throw: will
Syntax: cast <classname> planar beacon on <target>

This spell pinpoints a foe, regardless of what plane they are on, making
them glow like a beacon within the weave. They can then attempt to draw
this beacon to their current location. However, a foe with the strength of
mind to resist may cause the spell to backfire, instead sending the caster
to his or her target. Once this spell is used, the caster must rest for a
short while before attempting its use again.

Non-specialized mages cannot cast this spell.

Components, mage: sand x1, pinch of special dust x1 (or nil w. eschew
materials)

Spell: chain lightning
Class: mage/sorc L6
Sphere: invocation_evocation
Saving throw: reflex
Syntax: cast <classname> chain lightning on <target>

Chain lightning causes a great bolt of electrical energy to attack your
target.  After the bolt has attacked your target, the lightning bolt has
enough energy to continue jumping around the room, damaging other people
and anything else that happens to be in the room. A versatile arcanist can
manipulate the base element of this spell.

Components, mage/sorc: glass rod x1, fur x1, silver pin x1

Spell: transformation
Class: mage/sorc L6
Sphere: alteration
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> transformation

An experienced mage can use this spell to reshape their own body into a
powerful fighting machine. It adds extensive physical prowess to the
caster, as well as a degree of resilience, but comes at a price - while
active, the mage will be unable to concentrate enough to use offensive
spells. This spell does not work alongside similarly powerful melee spells,
such as rage, dance of a thousand cuts, or cunning insight.

Components, mage/sorc: fur x1, dung scrapings x1
