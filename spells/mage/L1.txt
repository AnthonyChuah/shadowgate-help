Spell: armor
Class: mage/sorc L1
Sphere: conjuration_summoning
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> armor

When armor is cast on someone, they will receive an AC bonus of up to 4.

is not considered armor.

Components, mage/sorc: blessed leather x1 (or nil w. eschew materials)

Spell: color spray
Class: mage/sorc L1
Sphere: illusion
Saving throw: reflex
Syntax: cast <classname> color spray

Color spray, when cast, will cause a blinding light of mixed colors to
flash from the caster.  All creatures not in the caster's party can be
blinded temporarily by this, or even knocked unconscious.


Spell: chill touch
Class: mage/sorc L1
Sphere: necromancy
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> chill touch on <target>

By casting this spell, your hand will flare up with a blue aura.  You can
touch your enemy with that hand and, if the target doesn't make his save
and avoid your touch, you will inflict a small amount of damage. 
Furthermore, the target will be slightly weakened until a certain length of
time runs out. A versatile arcanist can manipulate the base element of this
spell.


Spell: identify
Class: mage/sorc L1
Sphere: divination
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> identify on <object>

This is the spell for you to identify the enchantment of items (usually
equipment, though it may show attributes of other objects also).  The item
must be in your inventory or the room where you are.  NOTE: Anyone in the
same room with you will also know the enchantment of that item.

Components, mage/sorc: owlfeather x1, pearl x1

Spell: light
Class: cleric L1, paladin L1, mage/sorc L1
Sphere: alteration
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> light on <target>

This will create a small ball of light, which will light your way. You can
cast it on an object or player which it will follow, instead of the caster.


Spell: shocking grasp
Class: mage L1
Sphere: invocation_evocation
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> shocking grasp on <target>

This spell allows the mage to generate a small electrical charge in their
fingertips. They may then attempt to touch a foe, discharging it into them
in a powerful shock. A caster will find it far easier to contact a foe who
is carrying or wearing metal items, which will conduct the charge. While
this spell can, at first, be considerably more painful than other spells of
its sphere, a mage can only withhold so much charge in his fingertips, so
it will not take a great deal of study before the spell reaches its highest
potential.

Non-specialized mages cannot cast this spell.

Class: cleric L1, paladin L1, mage/sorc L1
Sphere: alteration
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> light on <target>

cast it on an object or player which it will follow, instead of the caster.


Spell: magic missile
Class: mage/sorc L1
Sphere: invocation_evocation
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> magic missile on <target>

Magic missile will shoot darts of magical energy from your hand and they
will fly towards your target with the unfailing ability to hit it.  The
damage it causes increases by level.


Spell: shield
Class: mage L1
Sphere: abjuration
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> shield

This spell calls a protective shield into existance before the caster. It
negates magic missiles, and provides a small bonus to armor class for its
duration. Use of a physical shield will interfere with the spell and cause
it to fade.
