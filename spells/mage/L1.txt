can only be cast once per day, though the creature can be called back and
correspondingly dismissed at any time.  Creature commands are as follows:

<call companion> will call it, at any time, if you have completed a
summoning ritual.

Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> shocking grasp on <target>

This spell allows the mage to generate a small electrical charge in their
fingertips. They may then attempt to touch a foe, discharging it into them
in a powerful shock. A caster will find it far easier to contact a foe who
is carrying or wearing metal items, which will conduct the charge. While
this spell can, at first, be considerably more painful than other spells of
its sphere, a mage can only withhold so much charge in his fingertips, so
it will not take a great deal of study before the spell reaches its highest
potential.

Non-specialized mages cannot cast this spell.

hesitation.
