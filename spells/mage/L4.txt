Spell: fear
Class: cleric L5, mage/sorc L4, psion L6, bard L3
Sphere: enchantment_charm
Domain: tyranny
Saving throw: will
Syntax: cast <classname> fear

Fear sends a wave of horrid thoughts and images out toward the foes around
the caster, possibly terrifying them.  It can make the creature briefly
flee in fright, or it may make him drop his weapons and cower before the
caster.

Components, mage/sorc: white feather x1 (or nil w. eschew materials)
Components, bard: dirge x2 (or nil w. eschew materials)

Spell: gust of wind
Class: mage/sorc L4, monk L13
Sphere: alteration
Saving throw: reflex
Syntax: cast <classname> gust of wind on <target>

Waving a pair of specially prepared feathers in the air, the caster is able
to generate a brief but intense gust of wind.  Using his left hand, the
caster directs the damaging winds into their target.  The power of the gust
of wind is dependant on the level of the caster.

Components, mage/sorc: wing feather x2 (or nil w. eschew materials)

Spell: detect scrying
Class: mage/sorc L4, bard L4
Sphere: divination
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> detect scrying

By means of this spell, the wizard immediately becomes aware of any attempt
to observe him by means of clairvoyance, clairaudience, or magic mirror. 
This also reveals the use of crystal balls or other magical scrying
devices, provided the attempt is within the area of effect of the spell. 
Since the spell is centered on the spellcaster, it moves with him, enabling
him to 'sweep' areas for the duration of the spell.

When a scrying attempt is detected, the scryer must immediately roll a
saving throw.  If this is failed, the appearance and general location of
the scryer immediately become known to the wizard who cast this spell. The
general location is the room and area where the scryer is located at the
time.

This spell does not protect from scrying, however.  Despite the fact that
you have detected the scrying, you cannot end the scrying without casting a
spell or using an object that protects from scrying.

Components, mage/sorc: tiny hearing trumpet x1, piece of mirror x1
Components, bard: rhyme x1 (or nil w. eschew materials)

Spell: shout
Class: mage/sorc L4, bard L4
Sphere: enchantment_charm
Saving throw: fort
Syntax: cast <classname> shout on <target>

This spell allows for the mage to magically enchant and enhance her voice,
to deliver a strong sonic attack against one target.  The amplified voice
can knock some targets off balance for a moment, forcing them to spend some
time for the ringing in their ears to pass.


Spell: wall of fire
Class: mage/sorc L4, monk L13
Sphere: invocation_evocation
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> wall of fire [on <exit>]

The spell, wall of fire, is an impressive spell for the magi indeed.  The
wizard can cast the wall around himself, protectively, or in front of an
exit, so all who pass through that exit will be scorched by the flames.  To
cast the wall around him/herself, the mage simply types <cast classname
wall of fire>.  Otherwise, the mage might type <cast classname wall of fire
on north> to damage those passing through the exit.  Be warned however, the
mage who casts this spell must keep concentration on the wall to maintain
its existence.  The mage may type <remove wall> to quench the flames. A
versatile arcanist can manipulate the base element of this spell.

Components, mage/sorc: phosphorus x1 (or nil w. eschew materials)

Spell: black tentacles
Class: mage L4
Sphere: conjuration_summoning
Saving throw: n/a

Spell: animate dead
Class: cleric L3, mage/sorc L4

This spell is pure evil, and only evil casters use it often. You can summon
a total number of hit dice worth of zombies and skeletons up to your
casting level.  They will follow you and defend you from your enemies. 
Unlike most common monster summoning spells, these monsters will not go
away unless the caster quits.  They are undead, so they can be turned, and
so forth, but they cannot be dispelled.

rain hail and ice down upon anything in the area.  The spell will not
damage the caster and lasts for a number of rounds equal to the caster's
level. A versatile arcanist can manipulate the base element of this spell.
