Spell: animate object
Class: cleric L6, bard L6
Sphere: alteration
Saving throw: will
Syntax: cast <classname> animate object on <object> || <room>

This spell allows you to animate objects and command then.  <command
objects to command> will command the object to act as instructed.  Forcing
an object to do something will affect your alignment when appropriate.  If
you cast the spell on 'room', you will animate the objects located on the
floor of the room (non living).  If you cast it on a non-living target,
that object will become animated.  If you cast it on a living being, items
from that being's inventory will be animated.

Enchanted objects cannot be animated.  Objects will take damage in combat
and may be destroyed.  The objects will remain animated until the spell
ends or you <dismiss objects>.

There is a level effect that limits how large or how many objects you can
animate.

Spell: acid arrow
Class: mage/sorc L2
Sphere: conjuration_summoning
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> acid arrow on <target>

When throwing a dart at a victim and casting the acid arrow spell, the dart
will turn into an acidic arrow with the aim and speed as if fired by a
fighter of the caster's spell level.  Damage will be inflicted immediately
upon hitting the target, then the acid will seep through the victim's
veins, doing more damage per combat round until the acid wears off or the
target is dead. A versatile arcanist can manipulate the base element of
this spell.

By making use of this power, a psion can hide his inner thoughts from

bypass this power's protection, but it will offer the psion some peace of
mind should he need it.

The choices for alignment are lawful good, neutral good, chaotic good,
lawful neutral, true neutral, chaotic neutral, lawful evil, neutral evil,
or chaotic evil.  Please make sure you do not capitalize any part of your

Spell: animate dead
Class: cleric L3, mage/sorc L4
Sphere: necromancy
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> animate dead (on <target>)

This spell is pure evil, and only evil casters use it often. You can summon
a total number of hit dice worth of zombies and skeletons up to your
casting level.  They will follow you and defend you from your enemies. 
Unlike most common monster summoning spells, these monsters will not go
away unless the caster quits.  They are undead, so they can be turned, and
so forth, but they cannot be dispelled.

Spell: animate plants
Class: druid L7
Sphere: alteration
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> animate plants

This spell will animate any foilage, roots, or plants in an area for the

Topic: acid_orb  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: acid orb
Class: mage/sorc L3
Sphere: invocation_evocation
Saving throw: reflex
Syntax: cast <classname> acid orb on <target>

This spell allows a mage to tap into the Para-Elemental Plane of Ooze and
borrow some of its energy to create an orb of pure acid.  Once the orb is
launched into the air, the first thing it strikes will cause it to burst
open, releasing the acid on the mage's foes.  Though care should be taken
as it is possible to accidently catch the mages allies in the blast.

Components, mage/sorc: citric acid x2, beeswax x1 (or nil w. eschew
materials)

Topic: acid_breath  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: acid breath
Class: mage/sorc L5
Sphere: alteration
Saving throw: reflex
Syntax: cast <classname> acid breath on <target>

This incantation allows for the mage to collect a pool of acid in his/her
mouth.  The magics of this spell prevent the caster from being harmed by
the acid while it is being collected.  The mage then is able to release the
acid as a breath weapon attack, the droplets of acid spinning around in a
cone.  More acid is able to be collected as the mage grows in power, making
the spell very deadly for a powerful caster.  Though it will become harder
for the mage to control the acid they stream forth, sometimes even
accidentally hitting friends or allies.

Topic: alter_self  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: alter self
Class: psywarrior L2, innate L1, psion L2, bard L2
Sphere: transmutation
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> alter self

This spell allows the caster to make minor changes to their body. These are
usually sufficient changes that they become unrecognizable even to those
they are familiar with. It does not allow for such drastic changes as body
size or overall shape; the caster would still be quite recognizable as a
creature of their race.

OOC: This spell does not alter details on your scoresheet (eyes, hair) but
the caster may describe their new form and features differently to these if
they so choose. They must still maintain their overall body shape (ie.
race, general height and weight).

You can only have one altered form with this spell - repeat uses do not
grant additional different shapeshifts, but instead return you to the same
secondary form. Adjective, description, speech, messages etc will be
remembered across castings, so they will only need to be set once in your
alternative form. Players will be able to recognise your 'other self' as a
unique entity, separate from your usual self.

manipulate the base element of this spell.

Topic: berserker  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: berserker
Class: cleric L7
Sphere: combat
Domain: war
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> berserker

This spell will fill the caster with the rage of war, causing him to
berserk madly.  The strength of the caster's deity and a blessed speed
result in blind fighting and reckless fearlessness. This spell does not
work in conjunction with similar magical effects, such as rally, rage,
haste, transformation, dance of a thousand cuts, or fell flight.

Note: Being berserk means that you are maddened with rage.  This is *not* a
state in which you can calmly participate in a normal conversation,
undertake delicate tasks, solve problems, or pretty much do anything other
than shout obscenities and kill things.

Please bear in mind that when you use the spell you are also expected to
roleplay it.

Topic: chameleon  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: chameleon
Class: psion L3
Sphere: illusion
Discipline: egoist
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> chameleon

Chameleon allows an egoist to cover himself with a thin sheen of ectoplasm
that he then wills to blend in perfectly with his surroundings.  This
renders the egoist invisible to all eyes (except those enchanted to see
invisible beings, of course).  Because of the nature of the power, the
egoist may attack while in this state, though the power has a chance to
drain from him every time he moves.

Components, psion: azurite x1 (or nil w. eschew materials)

Spell: cunning insight
Class: warlock L4
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> cunning insight

By means of this potent invocation, the warlock imbues his body with power,
thereby expanding his awareness and ability to resist and react to outside
forces. This results in an improved command of physical combat and weapon
handling, as well as a better aptitude at avoiding attacks. This invocation
does not work alongside similarly powerful melee spells, such as rage,
dance of a thousand cuts, or transformation.

Spell: casters lament
Class: warlock L4
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> casters lament (on <object> [at <player>])

This invocation harnesses the greatest of a warlock's natural aptitude for
manipulating magical energies and items. For the first, if cast with no
target, it will imbue the warlock with a considerable resistance to magical
attacks. If directed at an item, either in the caster's own inventory or in
that of another player, it can be used to shatter the magic upon a cursed
item.

Spell: cloudburst
Class: cleric L2
Sphere: elemental water
Domain: water
Saving throw: reflex
Syntax: cast <classname> cloudburst on <target>

The spell allows the priest to gather the water in the atmosphere to form a
cloud, from which he can release a torrential surge of rain over the
target.  As the caster grows in power, he is able to draw more moisture
into the cloud, creating a larger surge of water.  The target may find it
difficult to retain their footing among the surge.

Spell: chill touch
Class: mage/sorc L1
Sphere: necromancy
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> chill touch on <target>

By casting this spell, your hand will flare up with a blue aura.  You can
touch your enemy with that hand and, if the target doesn't make his save
and avoid your touch, you will inflict a small amount of damage. 
Furthermore, the target will be slightly weakened until a certain length of
time runs out. A versatile arcanist can manipulate the base element of this
spell.

Spell: charm monster
Class: cleric L7, bard L3
Sphere: enchantment_charm
Domain: charm
Saving throw: will
Syntax: cast <classname> charm monster on <target>

Casting this divine prayer will allow a priest to attempt to charm a mob. 
If the mob falls prey to the charm, they will stand in defense of the
caster, and follow them around.  Caution should be exercised, for if you
take any offensive actions against the charmed monster, the charm will end.
A caster may have only one charmed creature under their sway at one time.

OOC
Please exercise caution and good role-playing skills when using this
prayer.  Just because you have a monster charmed, does not mean people will
react well to it in crowded places.

Spell: cone of cold
Class: mage/sorc L5, monk L15
Sphere: invocation_evocation
Saving throw: reflex
Syntax: cast <classname> cone of cold on <target>

By casting this spell, you form a massive white cone of icy cold towards
your target.  Not only does this spell increase damagewise as the caster
increases in level, but also, the chance of hitting an unintended target in
addition to the intentional one increases too.  The mage will try to aim
the spell at only hostile targets, but this is not always possible.

Spell: cause blindness

Topic: catapsi  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: catapsi
Class: psywarrior L5, psion L5
Sphere: charm
Saving throw: will
Syntax: cast <classname> catapsi on <target>

This power can be one of the deadliest in the psion's arsenal, though it
causes very little damage.  By manifesting this power, the psion causes a
white noise to resonate in the mind of his target, leaving the target
unable to think, cast spells, or manifest powers.  This power is rightly
feared by psions and mages all over the realms.

Topic: cloud_mind  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: cloud mind
Class: psion L2
Sphere: alteration
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> cloud mind on <target>

This power allows the psion to create a minor alteration in the minds of
onlookers, so that they no longer see the target.  The effect moves with
the target, making him for all practical purposes invisible.  The power
will fail if the target becomes involved in a fight or decides to <appear>.
It may also wear off over time, though it generally lasts quite awhile.

Topic: control_object  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: control object
Class: psion L1
Sphere: alteration
Discipline: kineticist
Saving throw: will
Syntax: cast <classname> control object on <room> || <target>

This power can be used in two different ways. If cast on a room, the
psionic character draws forth matter from the Material Plane, which
coalesces into debris that protects the caster. Once per round, a piece of
debris will strike a random attacker, causing damage but destroying the
debris in the process.

If cast on a target, this power functions like animate object. Some
non-magical items in the target's inventory will be animated and fall under
the caster's command. To command the objects, simply use <command objects
to [command]>. Forcing an object to do something will affect your alignment
when appropriate. 

Enchanted objects cannot be animated. Objects will take damage in combat
and may be destroyed.  The objects will remain animated until the power
ends or you <dismiss objects>.

There is a level effect that limits how large or how many objects you can
animate.

Topic: cloak_of_shadows  	shadowgate System Help 	Category:
*spells

Spell: cloak of shadows
Class: warlock L4, monk L11
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> cloak of shadows on <vision|divination>

This invocation allows the warlock to draw a curtain of shadow energy
around him, concealing him from normal and magical detection attempts. It
can be used in two ways, though only one at a time. If cast on vision, it
will generate a more powerful magical concealment than standard
invisibility - it does not require the same direct concentration to
maintain, and so it does not fail if combat is initiated. If cast on
divination, it will potentially deflect magical divination attempts to
locate or watch the caster from a distance. If invisible, the caster can
simply forgo his concentration to <step> from the shadows, or with either
type of casting, it can simply be dispelled. Both effects can only be
centred upon the caster.

This power allows the psywarrior to create a suit of armor using only her

at the time of manifesting. If no choice is made, the armor will
automatically take the form of medium armor. In addition to any other IDs
the armor may have, the ID <energy armor> will always work.

Topic: commune  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: commune
Class: innate L1
Sphere: divination
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> commune on <target>

This spell, innate to all elves, allows them to communicate mentally with
one another.  However, it requires complete and total concentration and the
simplest act, even moving, breaks the connection.  The elves communicating
in this way must remain in the same room, or the connection will end.  It
will also render the caster completely vulnerable to physical attacks while
active and engaging in combat will also break the connection.

Topic: deny_the_reaper  	shadowgate System Help 	Category:
*spells

Spell: deny the reaper
Class: mage L7
Sphere: necromancy
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> deny the reaper on <target> (dead player's name)

This spell will send out necromantic energies to snatch a dead person away
from the afterlife.  The deceased will be returned to the site of death and
revived.  A successfully revived person will be barely alive and need
significant healing, due to the strain of being dragged away from death's
embrace, and will still be weakened by the touch of death despite their
restoration.

Non-specialized mages cannot cast this spell.

Components, mage: drop of blood x1, diamond dust x1

Topic: dimension_door  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: dimension door
Class: psywarrior L4, psion L4, bard L4
Sphere: alteration
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> dimension door to <location>

Through this spell the caster opens a 'door' in the fabric of reality,
attuned only to themselves.  They can use this to step through to a
location of their choice, only one that they have previously visited and
found to resonate with their soul.  A great deal of concentration is
required to enact such a spell, so the spell can be easily disrupted by
others.  Teleport warding effects that are of greater strength than the
caster, will thwart the spell entirely.

**** NOTE ****
Roleplay appropriately when using this spell.  Do NOT use it for any form
of OOC harrassment.  OOC lines can be used to communicate if necessary

Spell: dispel magic
Class: cleric L3, paladin L3, druid L4, mage/sorc L3, bard L3
Sphere: abjuration
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> dispel magic (on <target>)

Dispel Magic, when cast, will destroy any spell enchantments, any magical
summonings, and anything conjured.  The chances of each dispelling depends
on both the dispeller's casting level and the casting level of the wizard
or priest that created whatever is being dispelled, whether it be an
enchantment, summoning, or conjuration.

Spell: divine weapon
Class: cleric L2, paladin L1, druid L2
Sphere: conjuration_summoning
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> divine weapon

It is not uncommon for a priest or knight to be drawn into combat to
protect her faith or deity.  For that reason the gods have blessed their
servants with a prayer that grants them a divine weapon.  Each faith has a
different weapon, some say magical copies of the favored weapons on their
patron gods.  With this spell, a divine spellcaster will create a magical
weapon in their hand.

*NOTE*
Each weapon will have a few keywords to it, but all will have the name of
the weapon and 'weapon' for purpose of wielding, unwielding, and showing it
off.

Syntax: cast <classname> dragon scales on <target>

When cast, the spell will enchant the skin of the target to become covered
in draconic scales.  The scales will last for a certain duration depending
on the caster's level, and will vanish if the person wearing them quits
out.  The scales provide an innate armor bonus that is dependant upon
level, but cannot exceed +4. Some of the innate magic resistance of the
dragon scale will also cover the caster. This will only work on those
wearing mage-like armor.

Topic: devour_magic  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: devour magic
Class: warlock L4
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> devour magic [on <target>]

This invocation bears greater potency than its lesser cousin, voracious
dispelling. In a similar fashion, it will attempt to destroy any spell
enchantments, magical summonings, and anything conjured.  The chances of
each dispelling depends on both the dispeller's casting level and the power
level of the spellcaster that created whatever is being dispelled, whether
it be an enchantment, summoning, or conjuration. Unlike similar abilities,
however, any spells that are successfully opposed are instead consumed by
the invocation and used to heal the warlock's injuries.

Topic: detect_scrying  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: detect scrying
Class: mage/sorc L4, bard L4
Sphere: divination
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> detect scrying

By means of this spell, the wizard immediately becomes aware of any attempt
to observe him by means of clairvoyance, clairaudience, or magic mirror. 
This also reveals the use of crystal balls or other magical scrying
devices, provided the attempt is within the area of effect of the spell. 
Since the spell is centered on the spellcaster, it moves with him, enabling
him to 'sweep' areas for the duration of the spell.

When a scrying attempt is detected, the scryer must immediately roll a
saving throw.  If this is failed, the appearance and general location of
the scryer immediately become known to the wizard who cast this spell. The
general location is the room and area where the scryer is located at the
time.

This spell does not protect from scrying, however.  Despite the fact that
you have detected the scrying, you cannot end the scrying without casting a
spell or using an object that protects from scrying.

Components, mage/sorc: tiny hearing trumpet x1, piece of mirror x1
Components, bard: rhyme x1 (or nil w. eschew materials)

Topic: entropic_warding  	shadowgate System Help 	Category:
*spells

Spell: entropic warding
Class: warlock L1
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> entropic warding

The caster invokes chaotic energies into a field around their person, which
makes it harder to discern their exact location. This may cause physical
blows to miss them entirely. The shield has the added effect of preventing
any trail being left in their wake, either by footfall or by scent.

*spells

Spell: eldritch glaive
Class: warlock L3
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> eldritch glaive

A variant on the core spell-like ability of the warlock, this invocation
allows the caster to shape their eldritch blast into a single glaive, which
can be used as a melee weapon. Both hands must be empty in order for this
invocation to work; similarly, if a different shaped blast is invoked, the
glaive will disappear. Releasing grip upon the weapon will end the
invocation. As with the eldritch blast, the glaive can be imbued with
various essences.

Please note, this blast shape is not coded yet and cannot be used.

Topic: escape_detection  	shadowgate System Help 	Category:
*spells

Spell: escape detection
Class: psywarrior L3
Sphere: abjuration
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> escape detection [on <target>]

The target of this power can be a room or a person. If cast on a person,
the power's effect moves with them, sweeping the areas they pass though. 
If manifested without a target, the effect is centered on the room and
remains there.

By means of this power, the psionic character blocks all scrying attempts
on him/her by means of scrying spells and abilities like magic mirror and
remote viewing, or scrying objects like a crystal ball.  The power protects
against scrying attempts based on the level of the person attempting the
scrying as opposed to the level of the manifester with an intelligence
adjustment. If the level of the person scrying is high enough, the scryer
'burns through' the spell and the scry is successful.  A successful 'burn
through' does not end this power, and it does not alert the protected
person that it has been thwarted. If the protection is successful, magical
feedback interferes with the scrying magic and dispels it.

A scry detection power, such as 'detect remote viewing' or certain magical
items will detect a successful scrying attempt and thus can be used in
addition to this power to see if the scry protection has been thwarted.
This power can be manifested only while at peace.

Components, psywarrior: tourmaline x2 (or nil w. eschew materials)

Spell: energy current
Class: psion L5

Saving throw: reflex
Syntax: cast <classname> energy current as <type>

Upon manifesting this power, the kineticist generates a current of energy
that lashes out at those around him. Feats such as perfect caster and body
cognition can help ensure the psion strikes only foes. The psion must
choose one of the following energy types when manifesting the power: fire,
electricity, cold, acid, sonic, or random. If random is chosen, the energy
type may change each round. This power functions like an AOE storm, so it
does not stack with similar spells or powers.

*spells

Spell: elemental swarm
Class: druid L9
Sphere: elemental
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> elemental swarm on <target>

This spell will unleash the fury of the elemental planes on the caster's
foes.  A portal will open to a random elemental plane and an elder
elemental will come forth to aid the caster.  The elemental will fight
until it is slain or until the caster's enemies are killed.  If the
elemental is slain, another portal will open to a different elemental
plane.  This will continue until the caster is dead, until his or her foes
are all dead, or until an elemental has been called forth from each of the
planes of earth, air, fire, and water.

Topic: eldritch_burst  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: eldritch burst
Class: warlock L4
Saving throw: reflex
Syntax: cast <classname> eldritch burst

This is the pinnacle of the core spell-like ability of the warlock - the
ability to invoke pure planar energy and hurl it at a foe. Unlike its
primary form, the invocation emits in a burst from the caster, striking any
foe within reach. As this is not a ray, no touch attack is required, but
foes can attempt a reflex save to avoid part of the damage. As with the
eldritch blast, it can be imbued with various essences.

Spell: empower weapon
Class: psywarrior L5
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> empower weapon on <weapon> as <power name> |
<arguments to the power>

NOTE: This power may only be cast into a weapon and will not function
without that weapon in your inventory. Also, the weapon can store only
helpful powers, not those used for attacks. If you find that a particular
power cannot be used when you think it should be, please bug report it.

This power allows the psionic character to hold a power in reserve to be
called upon at a later time by typing <release>.  If the power reserved
normally requires a target, that target will automatically be the
manifester.  If you need to add arguments to the reserved power, you must
add them at the time of manifesting empower weapon.

example of usage:  manifest empower weapon on sword as dimension door | home

NOTE: You do need the | symbol if the power requires arguments such as a
location.

Topic: eldritch_blast  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: eldritch blast
Class: warlock L1
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> eldritch blast on <target>

This is the core spell-like ability of the warlock - the ability to invoke
pure planar energy and hurl it at a foe. As it is cast as a ray, it
requires a successful ranged touch attack to hit, and is subject to the
usual restrictions of spells and spell-like abilities (eg/ magic
resistance). While initially unremarkable, an accomplished warlock can
learn to reshape such a blast, or to imbue it with various essences.

Perfect Caster. Upon manifesting the power, the psionic character chooses

Topic: enthrall  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: enthrall
Class: warlock L2
Saving throw: will
Syntax: cast <classname> enthrall on <target>

By means of this invocation, the warlock will attempt to assert a degree of
mental control over the target. If successful, the target will follow the
caster around and try to protect them from harm. If the warlock harms the
enthralled creature, their control will be lost. Only one creature may be
controlled in this way at a time, and it will not work on other players,
although it may confuse them briefly.

OOC
Please exercise caution and good role-playing skills when using this
invocation.  Just because you have a monster charmed, does not mean people
will react well to it in crowded places.

Topic: earthquake  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: earthquake
Class: cleric L8, druid L8
Sphere: combat
Domain: cavern
Saving throw: reflex
Syntax: cast <classname> earthquake

By unleashing this spell, the caster calls forth a mighty earthquake to
trip and damage his foes.  The spell will last several rounds depending
upon the level of the priest, and the priest must remain present for the
spell to continue.  All those attacking the caster are subject to the
effects of the earthquake, though they do receive saving throws.

Topic: eldritch_claws  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: eldritch claws
Class: warlock L1
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> eldritch claws [on one hand]

A variant on the core spell-like ability of the warlock, this invocation
allows the caster to shape their eldritch blast into as many claws as they
have free hands, all of which can be used as melee weapons. If the warlock
has no free hands, the invocation will fail entirely; similarly, if a
different shaped eldritch ability is invoked, the claw/s will disappear.
Releasing grip upon a claw will cause it to disappear. As with eldritch
blast, the claw/s can be imbued with various essences; however as the
invocation is essentially a single shaping of the warlock's eldritch
ability, so only one essence may be harnessed at a time even between two
claws.

The manifester calls on the stuff of nightmares, disguising himself in a

enough to shake the confidence of those who oppose you, while the form
bolsters you, granting you some extra strength and protection from both
physical attacks and fire-based assaults. This power does not stack with
other damage resistance spells and powers (e.g. iron body, oak body,
stoneskin, resist energy).

Topic: forgotten_melody  	shadowgate System Help 	Category:
*spells

Spell: forgotten melody
Class: cleric L7, bard L5
Sphere: enchantment_charm
Domain: knowledge
Saving throw: will
Syntax: cast <classname> forgotten melody on <target> in <language>

This spell has the caster singing the beginning of a catchy tune.  The tune
gets locked in the head of the target listeners.  This prevents them from
doing anything involving concentration due to their infatuation with the
song.  The caster does not have to continue singing, as the spell's effects
are that the targets become lost in trying to figure out the tune.

Spell: fog cloud
Class: druid L2, mage/sorc L2

Syntax: cast <classname> fog cloud

When fog cloud is cast, a bank of dense fog moves into the area, making it
impossible for anyone, including the caster, to see more than a few inches
from his or her face.  The cloud will linger in the area for a few minutes
and then it will disipate on its own.

Topic: fortune_fate  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: fortune fate
Class: cleric L8
Sphere: healing
Domain: fate
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> fortune fate on <target>

This spell will cause the fates to smile on the target.  When cast, it will
activate a healing spell that will remain in reserve up until the target
falls below 25% of their maximum health.  When that point is reached, a
random healing spell, ranging from cure light wounds all the way up to heal
is cast on the target.

Tymorans believe that it is Lady Luck that smiles on them with this prayer,
giving them a healing boost when they need it most.  Those who follow the
Maid of Misfortune see it differently, that misfortune falls upon the
attacker, by healing the target.  Those who follow the Lord of the Dead
view this spell as protecting one from dying before their time.

This spell will call down a pillar of flame to engulf your foes.  It can be
used in two ways - when used before combat begins, it will engulf a single
foe; when cast during combat, it is particularly devastating, as it will
severely burn up to five enemies.  Beware, the caster should advise his
allies to not stand too close to the target of the spell!

Spell: false vision
Class: bard L5

Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> false vision (on target)

This illusion is designed to foil the attempts of scrying upon the caster. 
While active, anyone scrying out the caster will have to contest their
strength.  Should they succeed, the scrying will continue as normal.  If
they fail, they will instead be met with a vision designed to touch at
their innermost fears, to disrupt their scrying attempt and encourage them
not to try again.

Spell: flameburst
Class: cleric L7
Sphere: elemental fire
Domain: fire
Saving throw: fort
Syntax: cast <classname> flameburst on <target>

This spell will send a small ball of fire towards the target's chest.  If
the spell is successful, the ball will bury itself inside of the target's
flesh and begin to grow.  Over the next several moments, the fire will
consume the target's lungs and heart, and render them unable to move.  If
the spell is not dispelled before it has time to complete, the target's
chest will explode dealing great damage to him and anything near him.

Spell: flaming sphere
Class: druid L2
Sphere: invocation_evocation
Saving throw: reflex
Syntax: cast <classname> flaming sphere on <target>

When casting this spell, the druid creates a burning globe on the ground in
front of her.  The flames do not harm the environment, but the sphere
explodes when it makes contact with the target of the druid's wrath.  Those
standing nearby may be harmed as well.  The druid will make an effort to
aim at only attackers, but this is not always possible.

Topic: fell_flight  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: fell flight
Class: warlock L2
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> fell flight

This spell causes the warlock to sprout a set of wings, their nature
dependent upon the origins of their pact. As the wings are only shaped from
energy, they are not powerful enough to bear the caster aloft in true
flights of any length. However, they allow the warlock to drift in short
bursts to conserve energy when travelling, and may also be used to propel
the warlock with unexpected speed in combat, to land an extra attack
against a foe. This invocation does not work together with other
flight-based spells, nor similar spell buffs such as haste, rage or
berserker.

Topic: fire_seeds  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: fire seeds
Class: druid L6
Sphere: fire
Saving throw: reflex
Syntax: cast <classname> fire seeds on <target>

Upon casting this spell, a druid scoops up seeds from the surrounding
wilderness and enchants them before hurling them at his foes.  The seeds
explode upon impact, burning his foes.  The druid will make an attempt to
damage only foes, but that is not always possible, and targets have a
chance to avoid the brunt of the spell for half damage.  This spell can be
cast only in the wilderness.

NOTE: If you receive a message that you cannot cast the spell in a certain
room because of the terrain and you think you received the message in
error, please <bug here> and let us know so we can see if the terrain needs
to be adjusted.

Spell: frost orb
Class: mage/sorc L3
Sphere: invocation_evocation
Saving throw: reflex
Syntax: cast <classname> frost orb on <target>

This spell allows a mage to tap into the Para-Elemental Plane of Ice and
borrow some of its energy to create an orb of frost and ice.  Once the
freezing orb is launched into the air, the first thing it strikes will
cause it to burst open, releasing the chilling attack on the mage's foes. 
Though care should be taken as it is possible to accidently catch the mages
allies in the blast.

Spell: frozen breath
Class: cleric L5
Sphere: combat
Saving throw: reflex
Syntax: cast <classname> frozen breath on <target>

This spell will call forth a breath of ice to chill your foes.  It can be
used in two ways - when used before combat begins, it will engulf a single
foe; when cast during combat, it is particularly devastating, as it will
cause harm to up to five enemies. Beware, the caster should advise his
allies to not stand too close to the target of the spell!

Topic: flee_the_scene  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: flee the scene
Class: warlock L2
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> flee the scene on <direction>

This spell allows the caster to craft an illusion about themselves, before
slipping out of it a short distance away. The illusion remains behind for a
round, hopefully fooling those who might try to come after. The invocation
can be used in combat and will ignore mundane impediments, such as caltrops
or closed doors, but will be barred by magically sealed doors. Given the
very careful and draining spellcraft this invocation requires, it will take
a few moments before the warlock can cast it again after the first.

Topic: fold_space  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: fold space
Class: psion L8
Sphere: alteration
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> fold space to <location>

This power will move the psion from his current location to one he has
previously memorized.  The psion merely concentrates, setting his sights on
the place he would like to be, and his mind manipulates time and space to
place him there.  An example of the power's usage is <remember here as
cave>.  Then later on, the psion would type, <cast psion fold space to
cave>.  Again, you may also <unremember cave> to forget that particular
location.
This spell must be cast while at peace.

Spell: glamer
Class: warlock L2
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> glamer

This invocation creates an illusion to alter the warlock's features. It is
a drastic enough change that they become unrecognizable even to those they
are familiar with. It does not allow for such drastic changes as body size
or overall shape; the caster would still be quite recognizable as a
creature of their race.

OOC: This spell does not alter details on your scoresheet (eyes, hair) but
the caster may describe their new form and features differently to these if
they so choose. They must still maintain their overall body shape (ie.
race, general height and weight).

You can only have one altered form with this spell - repeat uses do not
grant additional different shapeshifts, but instead return you to the same
secondary form. Adjective, description, speech, messages etc will be
remembered across castings, so they will only need to be set once in your
alternative form. Players will be able to recognise your 'other self' as a
unique entity, separate from your usual self.

Topic: greater_stomp  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: greater stomp
Class: psywarrior L5
Sphere: combat
Saving throw: reflex
Syntax: cast <classname> greater stomp

The psionic character releases a torrent of psychic energy as she stomps
upon the earth, causing tremors to ripple throughout the area. She uses her
energy to feed the power, tripping and damaging her foes for several
rounds, provided she stays in the area. All those attacking the character
are subject to the effects of the stomp, though they do receive saving
throws.

Topic: genesis  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: genesis
Class: psion L2
Sphere: alteration
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> genesis

Manifesting the unusual power genesis allows the psion to create a small
demiplane for a time.  This plane exists only for the caster and those
invited in, or those who can find the original entry point.  Because of the
lesser nature of the power, the demiplane will not last forever, though it
can be held for longer as the psion gains in strength.

Components, psion: malachite x1 (or nil w. eschew materials)

Topic: glyph_of_warding  	shadowgate System Help 	Category:
*spells

Spell: glyph of warding
Class: cleric L4
Sphere: conjuration_summoning
Domain: creation
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> glyph of warding

By casting this spell, the priest uses his powers of generation to create a
mystical glyph that will protect a small circle around the area in which he
stands.  The glyph will alert the caster should any creature enter the area
protected by the glyph, and it will deliver a bit of a shock to the one who
does.  Any creature already within the protected area may leave without
disturbing the glyph.  If a creature was within the glyph when it was
created, he or she may enter again without triggering the protective
response.

Typically, priests have been known to use this spell to protect areas with
treasure or to help ensure privacy.  Because the glyph generates energy
that protects a circle, it will guard all exits in a room.  However - like
a circle - when it has been breached once, the energy will dissipate, and
the spell will end.  Additionally, thieves have a chance to search out and
disable glyphs, though it does take active concentration on their part.  A
thief must make the search in the room preceding the room the glyph is
thought to be in.

A priest may concentrate on only one glyph at a time, but he does not have
to remain in the room for the glyph to remain.

Topic: gale_fist  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: gale fist
Class: monk L11
Sphere: way of the elements
Discipline: way of the elements
Saving throw: will
Syntax: cast <classname> gale fist on <target>

This spell creates an enormous fist of tangible air above the target. The
fist will rapidly smash the target after a short delay, sometimes more than
once, on the first attempt the target rolls a will saving throw, if
successful the target will take only half damage. If the target fails the
saving throw, however, they will be momentarily stunned. The higher the
level of the caster the longer the period of time. Each additionl strike by
the fist will allow for a save to half damage, but the stun effect will not
apply beyond the first hit. 
NOTE: Each hit of the fist does 1d6 damage per caster level. The
probability of the fist hitting more than one time is partly based on level
and partly random.

Topic: gate  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: gate
Class: mage L9
Sphere: conjuration_summoning
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> gate on <summoning> 
	cast <classname> gate on <travel | location>

The spell of gate is only available to the most skilled of conjurers, and
holds twofold uses to its casting. The first is the use of the conjured
portal as a means of transit, both for the caster and his allies, to a
specified location previously memorized. The second is the use of the
portal to draw forth a powerful planar creature under the control of the
caster, to act as a servant and/or a protector. This is a greater summons,
and cannot be used simultaneously with other greater summons.

Non-specialized mages cannot cast this spell.

This spell will allow the caster to create a huge table, filled with

save them for later.

lasting as the shaper grows stronger.

Class: cleric L7
Sphere: combat
Domain: cold
Saving throw: reflex
Syntax: cast <classname> hypothermia on <target>

This spell creates a freezing ray of bitter cold.  The ray will seek to
drain the heat from the target as the cold moves through his body.  Because
it is a ray, there is a chance the target can dodge some of the bitter
cold.  However, if hit with the full force of the spell, the target will
also begin to grow chilled, eventually becoming frozen and blinded for a
time.

Spell: haste
Class: mage L3, bard L3
Sphere: alteration

This spell considerably speeds up the caster, and those allies in his or
her immediate vicinity. It grants all affected targets an extra attack if
they are striking in melee, as well as a small bonus to AC, reflex saves
and athletics. This spell does not work in conjunction with similar magical
effects, such as rage, berserker and fell flight.

Non-specialized mages cannot cast this spell.

Topic: holy_orb  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: holy orb
Class: cleric L5
Sphere: combat
Domain: good
Saving throw: reflex
Syntax: cast <classname> holy orb

The orb is a spell normally prepared by a priest who expects to encounter
enemies whose alignment opposes her own.  When cast, the spell streaks from
the caster's hand to the desired point of effect, where a sphere forms. 
The sphere drains the essence of life from the targets in the area of
effect.  The sphere does damage based on the alignment of the caster with
respect to the target.

NOTE: This spell will damage all attackers regardless of alignment, but the
damage will very if the attackers are players based on each individual's
alignment.  The damage done to mobs is consistent no matter the mob's
alignment.

battle.  NOTE:  This power does not work on players.  It will work only on

it. If cast within the presence of other beings, the caster may find that
the swarm annoys its victims so much that they attack the caster out of
anger and fear. At anytime the caster may send the swarm away by: <disperse

Topic: incendiary_cloud  	shadowgate System Help 	Category:
*spells

Spell: incendiary cloud
Class: mage/sorc L8
Sphere: invocation_evocation
Saving throw: varied
Syntax: cast <classname> incendiary cloud

Upon casting this spell, the mage conjures a heaving mass of smoke and
flames that blankets the area, scorching those who dare attack the caster. 
Like most fires, this one requires a brief time to build to a raging
inferno before it fizzles out again, leaving devastation in its wake.  If
the caster leaves the area, the cloud will dissipate. A versatile arcanist
can manipulate the base element of this spell.

materials)

Spell: invisibility
Class: mage/sorc L2, bard L2
Sphere: illusion
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> invisibility (on <target>)

This spell generally will let the caster turn himself or another creature
or player invisible until one of the three conditions are met.  The
invisible target has chosen to <appear> to all by typing that, the target
started a fight or was attacked, and the final way the spell would wear off
is from time.  The spell will last generally a long time if left to wear
off however.  Maintaining this spell can become wearying to the caster over
time.

Spell: lightning orb
Class: mage/sorc L3
Sphere: invocation_evocation
Saving throw: reflex
Syntax: cast <classname> lightning orb on <target>

This spell allows a mage to tap into the Para-Elemental Plane of Lightning
and borrow some of its energy to create an orb of pure lightning.  Once the
orb is launched into the air, the first thing it strikes will cause it to
burst open, releasing the shocking attack on the mage's foes.  Though care
should be taken as it is possible to accidently catch the mages allies in
the blast.

Topic: magic_mirror  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: magic mirror
Class: mage/sorc L7
Sphere: divination
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> magic mirror on <object> (a scrying mirror)

By means of this spell, the wizard changes a normal mirror into a scrying
device similar to a crystal ball. The details of the use of such a scrying
device can be accessed by typing <help mirror> after a successful cast on a
mirror.  You will be able to scry a player character or a location with the
scrying device made by this spell.

The mirror used must be of finely wrought and highly polished silver of a
minimum cost of 1,000 gp.  These mirrors are generally found only in
wizard's laboratories as they are both large and fragile, making them
impossible to carry around.

You will not be able to scry a character that you have not recognized
previously with the 'recognize' command.  Your chance of success in using
the mirror on a character is less if you recognize someone as something
other than their true name, but its better than nothing.  You may not scry
locations at all unless they are in memory via the remember command.

There is also a chance that the target of the spell may notice that they
are being scryed.  This depends on their class, and is adjusted
significantly by intelligence.  This operates independantly of any scry
detection magic or devices.  This spell can only be cast while at peace.

Components, mage/sorc: eye of roc x1, zinc x1, nitric acid x1, copper x1

Topic: mindnet  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: mindnet
Class: cleric L9, psion L8
Sphere: divination
Discipline: telepath
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> mindnet to <target>

This power is otherwise known as mass telepathy. It will allow the psion to
open a telepathy spell with more than one target at the same time.  Each
target will be able to 'hear' the thoughts of the other targets in the
mindnet.  The mindnet takes the game mechanic form of a line in the name
that the caster has themselves recognized as.

The actual name of the line is not considered to be IC information, but
rather a mechanical method by which to facilitate the spell. The caster
must cast the spell multiple times to add more targets to the spell, and
each time they cast the spell on a new target, that target is added to the
existing mind link.  It is possible for a person to be in two or more
mindnets at the same time, but it is not possible for one caster to have
two seperate mindnet spells under their control at the same time. The
caster may remove a person from the mindnet at any time by using <mindnet
remove target>.

When a psion manifests microcosm, he affects the target's mind to make him
feel as though he is happily in a world of his own, effectively rendering
the target utterly helpless.  The success of the power depends upon the
might of the psion against the target's hardiness.

Topic: mark_of_justice  	shadowgate System Help 	Category:
*spells

Spell: mark of justice
Class: cleric L5, paladin L4
Sphere: divination
Domain: vigilance
Saving throw: fort
Syntax: cast <classname> mark of justice on <target>

This spell allows the caster to attempt to plant a mark of justice on the
target.  This mark is mostly inconspicuous, being more an outpouring of the
caster's energy than a physical mark.  It will allow the caster to <observe
mark> once while the spell is in effect, giving the caster a means to scry
the target.  It is often used in investigations of suspicious persons, and
as such, it has been developed to be somewhat quietly cast.

Topic: mind_fog  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: mind fog
Class: mage L6
Sphere: enchantment_charm
Saving throw: will
Syntax: cast <classname> mind fog on <target>

Known only to some of the most powerful enchanters of the realm, this spell
does no visible damage to the victim.  Instead, it serves to cloud the mind
of the target, leaving them unable to think clearly, which incapacitates
the use of spells or powers.  This power is rightly feared by spellcasters
all over the realms.

Non-specialized mages cannot cast this spell.

Topic: mind_veil  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: mind veil
Class: warlock L3
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> mind veil

This invocation conjures a shroud of magical energy about the caster, which
will oppose all devices and spells that detect, influence or read emotions
or thoughts. Mind-effecting spells will not work against the warlock, and
basic divination attempts such as alignment will reveal nothing of note.
Greater divinations, such as scrying, will be opposed with by caster's own
magical strength. This invocation does not work in conjunction with other
alignment-altering effects, nor with other scry protection magics.

Spell: mire the mind
Class: warlock L3
Saving throw: will
Syntax: cast <classname> mire the mind

The caster creates a chilling aura around themselves, which insinuates
itself into the minds of nearby foes, should they not have the willpower to
resist. It will apply itself as a fog upon their thoughts, slowing their
combat reactions considerably. Creatures with only a single attack will not
be able to be slowed further.

*spells

Spell: magic vestments
Class: cleric L4
Sphere: conjuration_summoning
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> magic vestments

Calling for a blessing from their deity, the cleric can recieve magical
vestments that will protect them for a time.  The spell will not work if
the priest is wearing any form of armor on their torso, including leather,
chain, and armour types.  The magical vestments will grow in strength as
the priest's power grows, as will the duration.  The vestments are meant
only for the cleric, and can not be given to another.  To do so usually
brings about the wrath of their god upon the priest.

Spell: oak body
Class: psywarrior L5, psion L7
Sphere: alteration
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> oak body

By using this power, the psionic character lends some of his psychic energy
to protect himself. It causes the manifester to gain some resistance to
physical attacks, as well as immunity to most standard poisons. The oaken
nature of the power leaves the manifester vulnerable to fire attacks. The
oaken body brings a minor bonus to strength at the cost of dexterity. This
power does not work together with Stoneskin or Iron Body.

Spell: power leech
Class: psion L4
Sphere: necromancy
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> power leech on <target>

This power, when manifested, will cause the psion to gather his energy,
focusing on the target.  The psion will then reach out, attempting to touch
the target.  Should he succeed, he will empathically deliver damage to the
target, while healing his own wounds for the same amount.  Note: The psion
cannot gain extra hit points through this power.  He simply heals what he
has already lost.

Topic: prying_eyes  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: prying eyes
Class: mage L9
Sphere: divination
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> prying eyes on <target>

The pinnacle of ability for a skilled diviner, this spell allows the caster
to watch and listen in upon a distant person without the need for
components or a mirror. Or, they may focus upon their surroundings and then
depart, keeping watch over it in their absence. Many such magi couple this
with their clairvoyance skills to gain both close and long-range sight of
the target, as this spell does not show anything beyond the scope of its
immediate target. The caster will need to rest after attempting this kind
of spell, before re-attempting it again.

Non-specialized mages cannot cast this spell. This spell can only be cast
while at peace.

*spells

Spell: psionic teleport
Class: psion L5
Sphere: alteration
Discipline: nomad
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> psionic teleport to <location>

This power will move the nomad from his current location to one he has
previously memorized.  The nomad merely concentrates, setting his sights on
the place he would like to be, and his mind manipulates time and space to
place him there.  An example of the power's usage is <remember here as
cave>.  Then later on, the nomad would type, <cast psion psionic teleport
to cave>.  Again, you may also <unremember cave> to forget that particular
location. Note: The teleport power is not guaranteed, and the nomad may end
up in a place he did not intend.

Topic: powerword_kill  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: powerword kill
Class: mage L9
Sphere: enchantment_charm
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> powerword kill on <target>

When the powerword kill spell is uttered, any creature of the mage's choice
will drop dead if it has fewer current hit points then the mage's power.
The target may still be weakened even if this is not the case, but
creatures immune to death magic will be completely unaffected.

Non-specialized mages cannot cast this spell.

Spell: produce flame
Class: druid L1
Sphere: alteration
Saving throw: reflex
Syntax: cast <classname> produce flame on <target>

The druid opens his hand, palm up, and a flame as bright as a torch appears
there.  The flame will not harm the druid or his equipment, but when the
druid hurls the flame at an enemy, it explodes, fanning out to damage those
around him.  Although the druid will try to control the spell so as not to
damage allies, this may not always be possible.

Topic: phase_door  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: phase door
Class: psion L7
Sphere: alteration
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> phase door on <direction>

Manifesting this power allows a psion to teleport a short distance away.
The power can be used in combat and will ignore mundane impediments, such
as caltrops or closed doors, but will be barred by magically sealed doors.
During the short time the psion is away from this plane, he regains a small
amount of health and power points. Because it requires so much
concentration, the psion must rest a short time before manifesting this
power again. Should the psion be visible when this spell is manifested, a
shimmering prismatic light accompanies his movements.

Syntax: cast <classname> planar beacon on <target>

This spell pinpoints a foe, regardless of what plane they are on, making
them glow like a beacon within the weave. They can then attempt to draw
this beacon to their current location. However, a foe with the strength of
mind to resist may cause the spell to backfire, instead sending the caster
to his or her target. Once this spell is used, the caster must rest for a
short while before attempting its use again.

Non-specialized mages cannot cast this spell.

Topic: psionic_identify  	shadowgate System Help 	Category:
*spells

Spell: psionic identify
Class: psywarrior L2, psion L2
Sphere: divination
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> psionic identify on <object>

This power allows a psion to attune his mind, focusing on the moment of an
item's creation.  The psion then reveals what he has found, marking the
enchantment of the item as well as the name, should the item have a
specific one.  The psion does not know how an item is created using these
means; he simply knows what the lasting effect is.  The item must be in the
psion's hands or on the floor for the spell to work.

NOTE: Anyone in the same room with you will also know the enchantment of
that item.

Topic: planar_portal  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: planar portal
Class: psion L9
Sphere: alteration
Discipline: nomad
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> planar portal to <location>

This potent power enables a nomad to open up a portal, allowing beings to
pass from the place he currently stands to one he has locked firmly in his
memory.  By using this power, the nomad commands a temporary connection
between the two locations.  The power is taxing, however, so the portal
will not remain open very long.  An example of the power's usage is
<remember here as cave>.  Then later on, the nomad would type, <manifest
planar portal to cave>.  Again, you may also <unremember cave> to forget
that particular location.

Topic: rusting_grasp  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: rusting grasp

Sphere: invocation_evocation
Saving throw: fort
Syntax: cast <classname> rusting grasp on <target>

The caster of this spell invokes the power of nature to rust metal and

target suffers some damage and any metal objects in his inventory may also
be damaged.

Topic: resurrection  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: resurrection
Class: cleric L9
Sphere: healing
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> resurrection on <target> (dead player's name)

Praying to their diety for a miracle, a priest can attempt to resurrect a
slain ally back to life.  The resurrection, if successful, will restore the
corpse back to life and full of health.  The spell is somewhat draining on
the priest, for channeling large ammounts of divine power can be
exhausting.  The target will suffer significantly less (lower exp. loss)
from the death due to the intervention of the priest.

Topic: rage  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: rage
Class: cleric L7
Sphere: combat
Domain: animal
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> rage

This spell will enrage the caster, making him stronger and more deadly in
combat for the duration.  The strength of the caster's deity and a blessed
speed result in blind fighting and reckless fearlessness. This spell does
not work in conjunction with similar magical effects, such as rally,
berserker, haste, transformation, dance of a thousand cuts, or fell flight.

Note: Being enraged means that you are maddened uncontrollably.  This is
*not* a state in which you can calmly participate in a normal conversation,
undertake delicate tasks, solve problems, or pretty much do anything other
than shout obscenities and kill things. This spell does not work in
conjunction with similar magical effects, such as rally, rage, haste and
fell flight.

Please bear in mind that when you use the spell you are also expected to
roleplay it.

*spells

Spell: remote view trap
Class: psion L6
Sphere: divination
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> remote view trap

When manifesting this power, the psion attunes his mind to the detection of
magical and psionic abilities that attempt to scry him in some form.  The
power remains strong in the psion's mind, allowing him to move and retain
concentration on the power.

Should someone attempt to scry a psion while he has this power manifested,
a battle of wills and strength ensues.  The psion's latent psychic energy
will lash out at the one scrying him, causing damage.  The struggle then
continues, and if the psion wins, he immediately knows the description and
general location of the scryer.

Should the psion's will prove more powerful than the scryer's, this power
will likewise prevent the viewer from observing the psion.

Topic: remote_viewing  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: remote viewing
Class: psion L5
Sphere: divination
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> remote viewing on <object> (a crystal ball or
equivalent)

By means of this power, the psion changes a normal crystal ball or mirror
into a scrying device. The details of the use of such a scrying device can
be accessed by typing <help crystal ball> after a successful cast on a
crystal ball.  You will be able to scry a player character or a location
with the scrying device made by this power.

The crystal ball or mirror used must be of finely polished crystal of a
minimum cost of 1,000 gp - such ones are generally found only in psion
enclaves as they are both large and fragile, making them impossible to
carry around.

You will not be able to scry a character that you have not recognized
previously with the 'recognize' command.  Your chance of success in using
the crystal ball on a character is less if you recognize someone as
something other than their true name, but its better than nothing.  You may
not scry locations at all unless they are in memory via the remember
command.

There is also a chance that the target of the power may notice that they
are being scryed.  This depends on their class, and is adjusted
significantly by intelligence, and operates independantly of any scry
detection magic or devices.

Components, psion: banded amethyst x1, blue lace agate x1, sodalite x1, red
jasper x1

Topic: raise_dead  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: raise dead
Class: cleric L5, druid L4
Sphere: healing
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> raise dead on <target> (dead player's name)

This spell will revive a dead player when cast upon their corpse.  The
deceased will be returned to the site of death and revived.  Note it is
similar to being revived in a church as the person will be barely alive and
need significant healing.  The target will suffer somewhat less from the
death (lower exp. loss) due to the intervention of the priest.

In using this spell, the caster calls upon the might of the weather,
creating a powerful storm in an area.  The storm takes several rounds to

Topic: snare  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: snare
Class: druid L3, ranger L2
Sphere: conjuration_summoning
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> snare

In casting this spell, the ranger sets a snare in the location, which will
harm the first bypasser to trigger it. Anyone already present when the
spell is cast will be aware of the snare, and may come and go without
disturbing it. Additionally, thieves have a chance to actively search for
the snare and can remove it, but they must do so in the room before the
trapped location or they will trigger it.

The caster's attunement to the wilds will alert them when their snare is
tripped.  They may only rig one snare at a time, but do not need to remain
with it for it to function.  Snares can only be set in natural
surroundings.

Through this spell the caster attunes themselves with a nearby shadow and
steps into it, allowing near instantaneous travel to another destination of
their choice. A great deal of concentration is required to enact such a
spell, so the spell can be easily disrupted by others. Teleport warding
effects that are of greater strength than the caster, will thwart the spell
entirely.

Spell: spell turning
Class: mage L7
Sphere: abjuration
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> spell turning

The most skilled of abjurationists can use such a spell to raise a
protective ward around themselves. While it holds, it will have a chance to
reflect any spells which are directly aimed at the caster, regardless of
whether they are hostile or friendly. The ward will not reflect splash
damage or AOE, but only direct-targetted spells. This spell does not stack
with the 'reflection' or 'spell reflection' feats.

Non-specialized mages cannot cast this spell.

Components, mage: glass rod x1, small silver mirror x1 (or nil w. eschew
materials)

Topic: screen  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: screen
Class: cleric L6, mage/sorc L8
Sphere: illusion
Domain: illusion
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> screen

Upon casting this spell, the user creates a screen of illusion centered
upon himself that makes scrying attempts difficult.  This spell has a
chance to both detect and block scrying attempts, with the chance for
success determined by the level of the priest against the level of the
scryer.  The spell is centered upon the caster and will move with him,
allowing him to sweep areas for the duration of the spell.

When a scrying attempt is detected, the scryer must immediately roll a
saving throw.  If this is failed, the appearance and general location of
the scryer immediately become known to the one who cast this spell.  The
general location is the room and area where the scryer is located at the
time.

This spell can only be cast while at peace.

Topic: shocking_grasp  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: shocking grasp
Class: mage L1
Sphere: invocation_evocation
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> shocking grasp on <target>

This spell allows the mage to generate a small electrical charge in their
fingertips. They may then attempt to touch a foe, discharging it into them
in a powerful shock. A caster will find it far easier to contact a foe who
is carrying or wearing metal items, which will conduct the charge. While
this spell can, at first, be considerably more painful than other spells of
its sphere, a mage can only withhold so much charge in his fingertips, so
it will not take a great deal of study before the spell reaches its highest
potential.

Non-specialized mages cannot cast this spell.

Note: You do need the | symbol if the spell requires arguments, such as a
location.

Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> skate

This power gives the psionic character the ability to skate smoothly over
the ground, exerting little energy. The caster will find traveling over
long distances to be very easy when under the influence of this spell, and
will use very little stamina to travel.

Please note: This spell will remove your previously set enter and exit
messages.  If you had these set previously, you may need to reset them
after using the skate power.

summoning ritual.

Spell: scorcher
Class: mage/sorc L2
Sphere: invocation_evocation
Saving throw: reflex
Syntax: cast <classname> scorcher on <target>

When a mage casts this ferocious spell, fire blazes out of the caster's
hand towards a target, burning through all in the way.  The mage will make
an effort to aim at only attackers, but this is not always possible. While
the spell will reliably hit the primary target, a quick opponent may avoid
being caught by the worst of the flame's edges. A versatile arcanist can
manipulate the base element of this spell.

knock the target down as well as force him to drop his weapons.  The force
of the water may also keep him from moving until he regains his senses.

Spell: transformation
Class: mage/sorc L6
Sphere: alteration
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> transformation

An experienced mage can use this spell to reshape their own body into a
powerful fighting machine. It adds extensive physical prowess to the
caster, as well as a degree of resilience, but comes at a price - while
active, the mage will be unable to concentrate enough to use offensive
spells. This spell does not work alongside similarly powerful melee spells,
such as rage, dance of a thousand cuts, or cunning insight.

Spell: the dead walk
Class: warlock L2
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> the dead walk (on <target>)

This invocation draws upon the power of the Plane of Shadows, infusing the
recently dead with negative energy to reanimate their bodies as undead. You
can raise a total number of hit dice worth of zombies and skeletons up to
your casting level.  They will follow you and defend you from your enemies.
Unlike most common summoning spells, these monsters will not go away unless
the caster quits.  They are undead, so they can be turned, and so forth,

Spell: time hop

Syntax: cast <classname> time hop on <target>

The target of this power hops forward in time, disappearing in a flash of
silver energy. When the duration expires, the target reappears, feeling as
if no time has passed at all. Victims with a strong enough will are able to
resist the power's strength and either avoid it altogether or end the power
early.

Topic: timestop  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: timestop
Class: mage L9, bard L6
Sphere: alteration
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> timestop

This spell allows the transmuter to alter their immediate surroundings into
a state of such forced suspension that it would seem that time had stopped
for all but the caster.  This allows them to act normally while their
opponents can only watch, and will drop them out of direct combat. Foes
will force their way out of the spell after a brief interval, while the
very strongest of opponents may manage to resist the effect entirely.

Non-specialized mages cannot cast this spell.

Spell: truevenom
Class: psywarrior L4
Sphere: combat
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> truevenom on <weapon>

Upon using this power, the psionic character manifests a powerful poison to
coat his weapon. A target struck by the poisoned weapon will suffer the
same fate as any individual struck by the physical poisons found in the
world. This power allows the psionic character to manifest more powerful
poisons than those conjured by Prevenom. Once the poison has been applied,
a corrosive layer of ectoplasm remains, inflicting extra damage on the
psionic character's enemies for a short time.

NOTE: When using this power, you must specify a weapon as the target. The
first such weapon in your inventory will be chosen, and items in containers
will be ignored.

Spell: unravel psionics
Class: psion L9
Sphere: abjuration
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> unravel psionics [on <target>] or cast <classname>
unravel psionics on break curse

Unravel psionics is the most potent disruptive power in the psion's
arsenal. It can be used to destroy enchantments, summonings, and
conjurations. Like its arcane counterpart, the chances of each dispelling
depends on both the dispeller's casting level and the power level of the
spellcaster that created whatever is being dispelled. If this power targets
a particular item, it will attempt to remove any curses on the item,
similar to the break curse spell.

Topic: unholy_orb  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: unholy orb
Class: cleric L5
Sphere: combat
Domain: evil
Saving throw: reflex
Syntax: cast <classname> unholy orb

The orb is a spell normally prepared by a priest who expects to encounter
enemies whose alignment opposes her own.  When cast, the spell streaks from
the caster's hand to the desired point of effect, where a sphere forms. 
The sphere drains the essence of life from the targets in the area of
effect.  The sphere does damage based on the alignment of the caster with
respect to the target.

NOTE: This spell will damage all attackers regardless of alignment, but the
damage will very if the attackers are players based on each individual's
alignment.  The damage done to mobs is consistent no matter the mob's
alignment.

Saving throw: will
Syntax: cast <classname> voice of madness on <target>

This invocation will call upon beings beyond, unfathomable and terrifying,
to whisper in the ears of the target. A weak-willed target will become
overwhelmed by the maddening voices, and may babble incoherently, attack
the closest thing to them, or simply wander away.  When used on a player,
it simply causes them to stand and stare blankly.

Spell: vitriolic blast
Class: warlock L3
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: <blasttype vitriolic>

An eldritch blast with this essence applied will bypass all magic
resistance and AC of the target, unerringly finding its mark. It will cause
acidic residue to burn the target/s for further damage over several rounds.
Subsequent eldritch blasts will not stack this effect, but will refresh its
duration. This essence will also change the base type of the blast to acid.

Topic: walk_unseen  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: walk unseen
Class: warlock L2
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> walk unseen

This invocation places illusory spellcraft around the warlock, deceiving
the eyes of those around so as to effectively disappear from view. While
minor, a small degree of concentration is required to maintain the effect,
so it can become wearying over time. Becoming engaged in combat is
sufficiently distracting to lose control of the concealment; also, falling
unconscious will cause the invocation to fail. Of course, the warlock can
simply forgo the concentration to <appear> at any time.

Topic: warlocks_call  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: warlocks call
Class: warlock L2
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> warlocks call to <target>

This invocation allows a brief message to be sent to the target (less than
200 characters). . Doing so opens the warlock up to a response from the
target - either a message of a similarly short nature, or a harmful retort
of mental energy. If either message is too long, or either party takes more
than a minute to respond, the invocation will dissipate harmlessly. If the
target is ignoring the warlock or incapacitated in some way, the invocation
will fail.

Topic: wall_of_fire  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: wall of fire
Class: mage/sorc L4, monk L13
Sphere: invocation_evocation
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> wall of fire [on <exit>]

The spell, wall of fire, is an impressive spell for the magi indeed.  The
wizard can cast the wall around himself, protectively, or in front of an
exit, so all who pass through that exit will be scorched by the flames.  To
cast the wall around him/herself, the mage simply types <cast classname
wall of fire>.  Otherwise, the mage might type <cast classname wall of fire
on north> to damage those passing through the exit.  Be warned however, the
mage who casts this spell must keep concentration on the wall to maintain
its existence.  The mage may type <remove wall> to quench the flames. A
versatile arcanist can manipulate the base element of this spell.

Components, mage/sorc: phosphorus x1 (or nil w. eschew materials)

Topic: witchwood_step  	shadowgate System Help 	Category: *spells

Spell: witchwood step
Class: warlock L2
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> witchwood step

This invocation attunes the warlock to an element of flowing energy,
commonly that of air, water, or the chaotic fluctuations of the feywild.
Such energies will lie dormant in the caster's veins, triggering at the
next time the caster is stunned or tripped to grant them freedom from the
effect. The power of this invocation is such that the caster will need to
wait a brief period once activated before it can be cast again. It can only
be cast while at peace.

Topic: walk_the_planes  	shadowgate System Help 	Category:
*spells

Spell: walk the planes
Class: warlock L4
Saving throw: n/a
Syntax: cast <classname> walk the planes on <location>

This powerful invocation allows the warlock to travel along the edge of the
plane with which they bear affinity, using it as 'shortcut' of sorts to a
known destination upon the prime. Such travel will heal some of the
caster's injuries along the way, given their natural bond with that
particular plane. Any party-mates who are with the caster at the time are
considered to be willing subjects of the spell, and will travel alongside
the caster to his or her destination, if they are not pre-occupied with
combat.
